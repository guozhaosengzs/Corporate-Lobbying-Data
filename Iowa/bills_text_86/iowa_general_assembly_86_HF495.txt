  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with

 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation

 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by

  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from

  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection

 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body

 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed

  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private

  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall

  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.

  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with

 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.

  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body

 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.

 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or

 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with

 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement

  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by

  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.

 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.

 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written

 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent

  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.

  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7  1 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  7  2 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial

  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under

  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged

  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.

  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall

 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the

 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent

  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the

 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in

 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal

 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that

 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of

  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged

  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.

  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.

 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by

  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national

  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The

  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.

  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was

 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7  4 of if such a reason exists.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a

  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development

 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.

  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who

 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the

 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.

 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.

  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was

 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce

 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection

 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged

  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.

  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with

  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.

 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged

  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by

  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.

  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.

  6 19 subparagraph division (a) or (b).
  6 20    (d)  An attorney for a person described in subparagraph

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The

  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the

  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from

  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal

 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who

 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written

 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.

 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was

 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part

 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation

 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The

  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal

 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.

  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires

 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  6 28 consents in writing.  If consent is obtained, the agency shall
  6 29 provide the requesting person with a copy of the contents of
  6 30 such a recording.
  6 31    g.  Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a
  6 32 recording created by a body camera, the person who has the
  6 33 responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording on
  6 34 behalf of the agency, shall review all applicable and available
  6 35 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7  1 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  7  2 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  7  3 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  7  4 of if such a reason exists.
  7  5    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  7  6 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an

  7  9 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  7 10 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  7 11 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the

  7 14 during a criminal prosecution or civil action which is required
  7 15 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable

  7 19 civil action.
  7 20    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under

  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged

  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the

 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under

  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement

  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the

  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.

 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,

  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from

  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  6 35 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7  1 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  7  2 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 25                           EXPLANATION
  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in

  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency

  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent

  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the

  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written

  6 26 created by a body camera, may request a copy of such recording
  6 27 if each person who is part of the content of such a recording
  6 28 consents in writing.  If consent is obtained, the agency shall
  6 29 provide the requesting person with a copy of the contents of
  6 30 such a recording.
  6 31    g.  Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a
  6 32 recording created by a body camera, the person who has the
  6 33 responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording on
  6 34 behalf of the agency, shall review all applicable and available
  6 35 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  7  1 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  7  2 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  7  3 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  7  4 of if such a reason exists.
  7  5    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as

  7 13    8.  If an agency is unable to produce a body camera recording
  7 14 during a criminal prosecution or civil action which is required
  7 15 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  7 16 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  7 17 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  7 18 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  7 19 civil action.
  7 20    9.  The agency shall participate in any existing state or

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.

 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement

  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by

 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and

 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to

  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection

 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by

  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if

  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged

  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed

  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall

  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.

 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a

 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 14 during a criminal prosecution or civil action which is required
  7 15 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection

 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under

  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged

  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.

  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent

  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.

  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation

 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the

 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under

  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.

  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask

 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.

 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7  5    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  7  6 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an

  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that

  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.

  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed

  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board

  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.

 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall

  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.

  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection

 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace

  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency

  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the

  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall

  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires

 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.

 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 14 during a criminal prosecution or civil action which is required
  7 15 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  7 16 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the

  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by

  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.

  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall

  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 15 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable

  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed

  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement

  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if

 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed

  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.

  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent

  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.

 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged

  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by

  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent

 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,

 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),

  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent

  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.

 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement

 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with

 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

  7 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 28    This bill relates to racial profiling by security agents and
  7 29 requires peace officers to wear body cameras.
  7 30    RACIAL PROFILING ==== CITIZENS' REVIEW BOARD.  The bill
  7 31 defines  "racial profiling" to mean the practice of a security
  7 32 agent or law enforcement agency relying, to any degree, on
  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under

  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.

 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the

  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.

 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the

 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires

 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with

  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national

  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.

  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall

  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.

  7 33 race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion in selecting
  7 34 which individuals are subject to routine or spontaneous
  7 35 investigatory activities or in deciding upon the scope and
  8  1 substance of law enforcement activity following the initial
  8  2 investigatory procedure, except when there is trustworthy
  8  3 information, relevant to the locality and time frame, that
  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the

 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the

 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.

 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.

 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.

 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement

  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to

  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection

 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.

 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,

 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement

 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

  8  4 links a person of a particular race, ethnicity, national
  8  5 origin, or religion to an identified criminal incident or
  8  6 scheme.  The bill defines "security agent" to mean a peace
  8  7 officer as defined in Code section 801.4(11)(a), (b), (c),
  8  8 (f), (g), or (h), a certified law enforcement officer under
  8  9 Code  section 80B.18, a person who is an employee or agent of
  8 10 a private security business licensed under Code chapter 80A,
  8 11 or any other person who is designated to provide security at a
  8 12 business. The bill also defines "law enforcement agency" to
  8 13 mean any state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency engaged
  8 14 in the prevention, detection, or investigation of violations
  8 15 of criminal, immigration, or customs laws. "Law enforcement
  8 16 agency" also includes a private security business licensed
  8 17 under Code chapter 80A, or any other person providing security
  8 18 at a place of business.
  8 19    The bill prohibits a security agent or law enforcement
  8 20 agency from engaging in racial profiling.
  8 21    The bill requires the state and each political subdivision
  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the

 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,

 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.

 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss

 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent

  8 22 of the state to establish a citizens' review board to review
  8 23 complaints of racial profiling made against a law enforcement
  8 24 agency or security agent within their respective jurisdiction.
  8 25 The majority of the membership of the board shall consist of
  8 26 people from minority groups disproportionately impacted by
  8 27 racial profiling and persons who are not security agents. The
  8 28 board shall establish policies and procedures designed to
  8 29 assist in the elimination of racial profiling.
  8 30    The bill provides that the citizens' review board shall
  8 31 inform the complainant of any possible remedies that may be
  8 32 available to the complainant.  The bill specifies that the
  8 33 findings of the citizens' review board shall be admissible in
  8 34 any criminal or civil proceeding.
  8 35    If a citizens' review board finds that a security agent
  9  1 who is a peace officer or certified law enforcement officer
  9  2 engaged in racial profiling, the bill requires that the board
  9  3 notify the agency employing the security agent and the agency
  9  4 shall initiate procedures to suspend the security agent from
  9  5 performing the security agent's official duties.  If such
  9  6 security agent is found to have engaged in racial profiling
  9  7 a second time by the board, the bill requires the agency to
  9  8 initiate procedures to suspend the security agent for a longer
  9  9 period than the first suspension.  Upon a third or subsequent
  9 10 finding that such security agent has engaged in racial
  9 11 profiling, the agency shall initiate procedures to dismiss
  9 12 the security agent from performing the official duties of the
  9 13 agent.
  9 14    If the security agent is an employee or agent of a private
  9 15 security business licensed under Code chapter 80A, or any other
  9 16 person who is designated to provide security at a business,
  9 17 and the board finds the security agent engaged in racial
  9 18 profiling, the bill requires the board to notify the security
  9 19 agent that the security agent has engaged in racial profiling.
  9 20 The bill also provides that the citizens' review board shall
  9 21 also provide such notification to the employer of the agent, if
  9 22 applicable, and the place of business where the security agent
  9 23 provides security.
  9 24    The bill specifies that a person or the department of justice
  9 25 may bring an action to enjoin a violation of the bill.
  9 26    Prior to a law enforcement agency receiving moneys from the
  9 27 state, the bill requires the agency to certify that the agency
  9 28 maintains adequate policies and procedures for eliminating any
  9 29 existing practices that permit or encourage racial profiling.
  9 30    The department of justice may enter into contracts for the
  9 31 collection of data relating to the bill and for the development
  9 32 of best practices and systems to eliminate racial profiling.
  9 33    The bill specifies that the department of justice shall
  9 34 adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A for the collection
  9 35 and compilation of data on racial profiling and for the
 10  1 implementation of the bill.
 10  2    BODY CAMERAS.  The bill defines "agency" to mean a law
 10  3 enforcement agency.
 10  4    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
 10  5 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
 10  6 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
 10  7 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
 10  8    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
 10  9 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
 10 10 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
 10 11 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
 10 12 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
 10 13 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
 10 14 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
 10 15    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
 10 16 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
 10 17 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
 10 18 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
 10 19 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
 10 20    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
 10 21 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
 10 22    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
 10 23 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
 10 24 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
 10 25 warrant.
 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body
 10 33 camera recording while the peace officer is in the residence.
 10 34 If the person responds in the affirmative, the bill requires
 10 35 the peace officer to stop the body camera recording.  The bill
 11  1 also requires the peace officer to record the question and any
 11  2 answer to the question.
 11  3    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
 11  4 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
 11  5 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
 11  6 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
 11  7 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
 11  8 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
 11  9 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
 11 10 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
 11 11 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
 11 12    The contents of a recording created by a body camera are
 11 13 confidential except as provided for in the bill.
 11 14    The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents
 11 15 of a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However,
 11 16 an agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by
 11 17 a body camera for three years if any of the following apply:
 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body

 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who
 11 32 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,
 12  1 or involved with a crime that is related to the recording; any
 12  2 other person if such person has been given written authority
 12  3 to disclose the contents of the recording by the person who
 12  4 is part of the content of the recording or whose property was
 12  5 seized or damaged.
 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal

 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.

 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 13  1 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 13  2 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 13  3 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 13  4 mandate included in the bill.

 10 26    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
 10 27 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
 10 28 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
 10 29    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
 10 30 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
 10 31 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
 10 32 whether the resident desires the peace officer to stop the body

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal
 11 21 or informal complaint against a peace officer or agency; or
 11 22 a request has been made to retain the recording.  Under the
 11 23 bill, the contents of the recording may be retained even longer
 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
 11 28 for three years: a person who is a part of the content of the
 11 29 recording; a person whose property has been seized or damaged
 11 30 in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
 11 31 related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a person who

 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the

 12  6    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
 12  7 content of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
 12  8 copy of and receive such recording if each person who is part
 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
 12 12 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
 12 13 on behalf of the agency, to review all applicable and available
 12 14 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
 12 15 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
 12 16    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
 12 17 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
 12 18 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
 12 19 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
 12 30 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
 12 31 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
 12 32 officers.
 12 33    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 12 34 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 12 35 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

 11 18 the recording depicts an incident involving the use of force;
 11 19 the recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or
 11 20 arrest of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal

 11 24 than three years if the contents may be relevant to a criminal
 11 25 prosecution.
 11 26    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
 11 27 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained

 11 33 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
 11 34 the recording; the attorney for a person who is part of the
 11 35 content of the recording or whose property was seized, damaged,

 12  9 of the content of the recording consents in writing.
 12 10    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
 12 11 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has

 12 20 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
 12 21 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
 12 22 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
 12 23    The bill also provides that if an agency is unable to produce
 12 24 a body camera recording during a criminal prosecution or civil
 12 25 action, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
 12 26 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
 12 27 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
 12 28 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
 12 29    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
