 16 22                           EXPLANATION
 16 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 25    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 16 26 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 16 27 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 16 28 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 16 29 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 16 30 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 16 31 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 16 32 481A.42).
 16 33    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 16 34 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 16 35 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17  1 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17  2 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17  3 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17  4 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 17  5 Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 17 10 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 17 11 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 17 12 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 17 13 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17  4 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 17  5 Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;

 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal

 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 17 10 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 17 11 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 17 12 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 17 13 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 16 28 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 16 29 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 16 30 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 16 31 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 16 32 481A.42).
 16 33    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including

 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 17 10 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 17 11 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section

 17 12 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 17 13 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 16 25    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 16 26 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 16 27 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 16 28 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 16 29 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 16 30 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 16 31 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 16 32 481A.42).
 16 33    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including

 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 17 10 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 17 11 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section

 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 16 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 25    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 16 26 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 16 27 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 16 28 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 16 29 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 16 30 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 16 31 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 16 32 481A.42).
 16 33    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 16 34 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 16 35 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17  1 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17  2 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17  3 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17  4 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 17  5 Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 17 10 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 17 11 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 17 12 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 17 13 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.

 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of

 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 16 25    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 16 26 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 16 27 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 16 28 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 16 29 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 16 30 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 16 31 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 16 32 481A.42).
 16 33    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 16 34 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 16 35 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17  1 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17  2 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17  3 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17  4 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 17  5 Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 17 10 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 17 11 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 17 12 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 17 13 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each

 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.

 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and

 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the

 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more

 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each

 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 16 29 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 16 30 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 16 31 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 16 32 481A.42).
 16 33    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 16 34 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 16 35 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17  1 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17  2 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 17  3 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17  4 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 17  5 Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 17 10 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 17 11 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 17 12 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 17 13 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.

 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.

 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with

 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to

 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with

 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;

 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may

 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)

 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17  3 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 17  4 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 17  5 Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 17  9 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 17 10 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 17 11 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 17 12 717C.1); committed an offense involving animal fighting (Code
 17 13 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 18 30 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.

 17  5 Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 17  6 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 17  7 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 17  8 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has

 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct

 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly

 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the

 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two

 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if

 17 13 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 17 14 state.
 17 15    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES BASED ON OBSERVED INJURY.  Animal
 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to

 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a

 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that

 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are

 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,

 17 16 abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or poisoning;
 17 17 animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal with
 17 18 adequate food, water, or habitable conditions; and animal
 17 19 torture involves inflicting upon the animal severe and
 17 20 prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For animal abuse in
 17 21 the first or second degree, animal neglect in the first or
 17 22 second degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a
 17 23 serious injury meaning a substantial risk of death, protracted
 17 24 disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb.
 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first
 17 33 degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a
 17 34 class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the second degree, a
 17 35 serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to an aggravated
 18  1 misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D" felony which
 18  2 may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 18  3    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 18  4 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 18  5 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 18  6 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 18  7 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 18  8 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for

 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;

 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:

 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a

 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or

 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with

 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report

 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 25 For animal abuse in the second degree or animal neglect in
 17 26 the second degree, the animal must suffer some injury to the
 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the
 17 31 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 17 32 an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect in the first

 17 27 animal's body. For these observable injury=related offenses,
 17 28 the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1) animal abuse
 17 29 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may
 17 30 be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse in the

 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,

 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a

 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 19 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 19 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 19 29    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18  9 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 18 10 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 18 11 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 18 12 sadistic or depraved intent.

 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary

 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES NOT BASED ON AN OBSERVED INJURY.
 18 14 For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly or recklessly
 18 15 relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail to provide for
 18 16 its legal transfer or make arrangements for its care. For
 18 17 animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal in a
 18 18 stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the health
 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 18 25 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 18 26 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 18 27 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 18 28 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 18 29 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a

 18 31 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 18 32 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 18 33    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 18 34 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 18 35 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19  1 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 19  2 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 19  3 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 19  4 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 19  5 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 19  6 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 19  7 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 19  8 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 19  9 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 19 10 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 19 11 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 19 12 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 19 13 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 19 14 felony.
 19 15    ANIMAL RESCUE.  A law enforcement officer (e.g., county
 19 16 sheriff or deputy sheriff) is authorized to rescue an animal
 19 17 from a motor vehicle based upon the officer's reasonable belief
 19 18 that the animal may be suffering distress.  The officer must
 19 19 provide a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the
 19 20 animal must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local
 19 21 authority until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court
 19 22 order.
 19 23    MANDATORY REPORTING.  A veterinarian is required to report
 19 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 19 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 19 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.

 18 19 or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 18 20 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 18 21 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 18 22    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 18 23 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 18 24 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 19 30 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 19 31 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 19 32 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 19 33 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 19 34 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 19 35 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.
