claims
received
15


for

An

is
required
to

the

that
exceeds
75
20


percent
of
the
face
value
of
the
policy
covering
the

demolition
of
the
building
or
structure
and
has
so
notified
30


the

The

31


receives
notice
from
both
the
insured
and
the
county
board
32


of
supervisors
that
the
insured
has
completed
