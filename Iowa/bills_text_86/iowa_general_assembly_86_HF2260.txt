  4 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 24    This bill relates to education funding by extending the
  4 25 period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in the
  4 26 secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund, specifying
  4 27 uses for funding received from the secure an advanced vision
  4 28 for education fund, and authorizing school districts to adopt a
  4 29 district cost per pupil equity budget adjustment.
  4 30    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  4 31 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  4 32 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  4 33 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
  4 34 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  4 35 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  5  1 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  5  2 of amounts required for the natural resources and outdoor
  5  3 recreation trust fund, one=sixth of the remaining state sales
  5  4 tax revenue from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE
  5  5 fund created in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund
  5  6 are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to be
  5  7 used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  5  8 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  5  9 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  5 10 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  5 11 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  5 12    The bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate and the
  5 13 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  5 14    The bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity budget
  5 15 adjustment.  The board of directors of a school district with
  5 16 a regular program district cost per pupil that is less than
  5 17 the highest regular program district cost per pupil among all
  5 18 school districts in the state for the same budget year may
  5 19 annually adopt a resolution to receive the budget adjustment
  5 20 authorized in the bill. Following adoption of the resolution
  5 21 the board of directors must notify the department of management
  5 22 of the adoption of the resolution and the amount of the budget
  5 23 adjustment to be received.
  5 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  5 25 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  5 26 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
  5 27 between the school district's regular program district cost
  5 28 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
  5 29 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
  5 30 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
  5 31 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
  5 32 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
  5 33 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
  5 34 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
  5 35 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
  6  1 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
  6  2 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
  6  3 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
  6  4 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines
  6  5 "instructional expenditures".
  6  6    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  6  7 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  6  8 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  6  9 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  6 10 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  6 11 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  6 12 future budget year.
  6 13    As part of the restrictions on the use of revenues
  6 14 received from the SAVE fund, Code section 423F.3 defines
  6 15 "school infrastructure" to mean, in part, those activities
  6 16 authorized in Code section 423E.1(3), Code 2007, which
  6 17 includes the construction, reconstruction, repair, demolition,
  6 18 purchase, or remodeling of a stadium.  The bill excludes such
  6 19 stadium=related activities unless specifically included in a
  6 20 revenue purpose statement approved by the electors on or before
  6 21 July 1, 2016.
  6 22    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
  6 23 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
  6 24 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
  6 25 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue
  6 26 purpose statement. Those additional purposes include: (1)
  6 27 certain transportation costs if a school district's average
  6 28 transportation costs per pupil exceed the state average
  6 29 transportation costs per pupil; (2) funding a district cost per
  6 30 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
  6 31 (3) a reduction of the school district's additional property
  6 32 tax levy.
  6 33    Code section 423F.3, subsection 7, provides that the
  6 34 general assembly shall not alter the purposes for which the
  6 35 revenues received under Code section 423F.3 may be used from
  7  1 infrastructure and property tax relief purposes to any other
  7  2 purpose unless the bill is approved by a vote of at least
  7  3 two=thirds of the members of both chambers of the general
  7  4 assembly and is signed by the governor.

  5 12    The bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate and the
  5 13 statutory repeal of Code chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  5 14    The bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity budget
  5 15 adjustment.  The board of directors of a school district with

  5 18 school districts in the state for the same budget year may

  5 21 the board of directors must notify the department of management
  5 22 of the adoption of the resolution and the amount of the budget

  5 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  5 25 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  5 26 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
  5 27 between the school district's regular program district cost
  5 28 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
  5 29 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
  5 30 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
  5 31 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
  5 32 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
  5 33 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
  5 34 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for

  6  8 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  6  9 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  6 10 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  6 11 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  6 12 future budget year.
  6 13    As part of the restrictions on the use of revenues
  6 14 received from the SAVE fund, Code section 423F.3 defines

  6 20 revenue purpose statement approved by the electors on or before
  6 21 July 1, 2016.
  6 22    The bill also specifies additional purposes for which a
  6 23 school district may use funds received from the SAVE fund
  6 24 in school budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,
  6 25 if the purpose is included in a voter=approved revenue

  4 34 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  4 35 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  5  1 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  5  2 of amounts required for the natural resources and outdoor
  5  3 recreation trust fund, one=sixth of the remaining state sales
  5  4 tax revenue from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE
  5  5 fund created in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund
  5  6 are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to be
  5  7 used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  5  8 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  5  9 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,

  5 25 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  5 26 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
  5 27 between the school district's regular program district cost
  5 28 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
  5 29 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
  5 30 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
  5 31 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
  5 32 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
  5 33 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
  5 34 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
  5 35 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
  6  1 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
  6  2 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional

  6 10 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  6 11 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  6 12 future budget year.
  6 13    As part of the restrictions on the use of revenues
  6 14 received from the SAVE fund, Code section 423F.3 defines

  4 32 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  4 33 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
  4 34 consumers, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  4 35 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  5  1 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer

  5  4 tax revenue from the 6 percent tax is transferred to the SAVE
  5  5 fund created in Code section 423F.2. Moneys in the SAVE fund
  5  6 are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to be
  5  7 used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  5  8 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  5  9 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,

  5 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  5 25 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  5 26 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference
  5 27 between the school district's regular program district cost
  5 28 per pupil and the highest regular program district cost per
  5 29 pupil among all school districts in the state multiplied by the
  5 30 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
  5 31 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
  5 32 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
  5 33 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
  5 34 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
  5 35 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
  6  1 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
  6  2 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional

  5 20 authorized in the bill. Following adoption of the resolution
  5 21 the board of directors must notify the department of management
  5 22 of the adoption of the resolution and the amount of the budget
  5 23 adjustment to be received.
  5 24    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  5 25 eligible school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  5 26 for that budget year in an amount equal to the difference

  5 30 district's budget enrollment. The resolution authorizing the
  5 31 budget adjustment may specify a budget adjustment amount that
  5 32 is less than the maximum amount authorized under the bill. The
  5 33 bill requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment
  5 34 by using moneys received from the SAVE fund and authorized for
  5 35 such purpose in a revenue purpose statement. Amounts used to
  6  1 fund the budget adjustment are required to be excluded from
  6  2 collective bargaining and must be used solely for instructional
  6  3 expenditures and must supplement, not supplant, existing school
  6  4 funding for instructional expenditures. The bill defines

  6  7 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  6  8 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  6  9 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  6 10 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  6 11 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  6 12 future budget year.
  6 13    As part of the restrictions on the use of revenues
  6 14 received from the SAVE fund, Code section 423F.3 defines
  6 15 "school infrastructure" to mean, in part, those activities
  6 16 authorized in Code section 423E.1(3), Code 2007, which
  6 17 includes the construction, reconstruction, repair, demolition,
  6 18 purchase, or remodeling of a stadium.  The bill excludes such
