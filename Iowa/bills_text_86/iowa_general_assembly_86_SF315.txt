  2 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 29    Under current law, when the new owner of a vehicle subject to
  2 30 registration applies for registration and certificate of title,
  2 31 a fee for new registration is due in the amount of 5 percent of
  2 32 the purchase price of the vehicle.  In transactions in which a
  2 33 vehicle is traded toward the purchase price of another vehicle,
  2 34 the value of the trade=in is excluded from the purchase price
  2 35 of the vehicle when calculating the fee for new registration.
  3  1 This bill provides for a similar calculation of the purchase
  3  2 price in cases where a person sells one vehicle and purchases
  3  3 another vehicle in separate transactions.  Under the bill, if a
  3  4 person sells a vehicle subject to registration to an in=state
  3  5 or out=of=state purchaser and purchases another vehicle within
  3  6 60 days before or after the sale, the amount of the sales
  3  7 price of the vehicle sold is treated as trade=in value and is
  3  8 exempt from the purchase price used to calculate the fee for
  3  9 new registration for the vehicle purchased.  If the qualifying
  3 10 sale of a vehicle occurs before the fee for new registration
  3 11 is paid for the newly purchased vehicle, the exemption shall
  3 12 be included in the calculation of the fee for new registration
  3 13 which is remitted to the county treasurer by the owner, or, if
  3 14 the vehicle is purchased from a dealer, by the dealer on the
  3 15 owner's behalf, along with the application for registration
  3 16 and certificate of title.  The owner must provide proof of the
  3 17 qualifying vehicle sale and the sales price of the vehicle
  3 18 sold. If the qualifying sale occurs after the fee for new
  3 19 registration is paid for the newly purchased vehicle, the owner
  3 20 may apply to the county treasurer for a refund of the amount
  3 21 of the fee paid in excess of the amount owed.  The application
  3 22 for a refund must be accompanied by proof that the fee for new
  3 23 registration for the newly purchased vehicle has been paid and
  3 24 proof of the qualifying sale of another vehicle and the sales
  3 25 price of that vehicle. The department of revenue has 60 days
  3 26 in which to issue a refund of the excess payment or notify
  3 27 the owner that the application for a refund is denied and the
  3 28 reason for the denial.
  3 29    In accordance with current law relating to the calculation
  3 30 of the purchase price in transactions involving traded
  3 31 vehicles, the name or names on the title and registration of
  3 32 the vehicle purchased must be the same as the name or names on
  3 33 the title and registration of the vehicle sold, with certain
  3 34 exceptions for transactions involving spousal ownership and

  2 30 registration applies for registration and certificate of title,
  2 31 a fee for new registration is due in the amount of 5 percent of

  3  7 price of the vehicle sold is treated as trade=in value and is
  3  8 exempt from the purchase price used to calculate the fee for

  3 12 be included in the calculation of the fee for new registration
  3 13 which is remitted to the county treasurer by the owner, or, if

  3 16 and certificate of title.  The owner must provide proof of the

  3 19 registration is paid for the newly purchased vehicle, the owner

  3 21 of the fee paid in excess of the amount owed.  The application

  3 24 proof of the qualifying sale of another vehicle and the sales
  3 25 price of that vehicle. The department of revenue has 60 days
