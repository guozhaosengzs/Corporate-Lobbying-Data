 24  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 24  4    CURRENT LAW.  Code chapter 162 provides for the regulation
 24  5 of commercial establishments that possess or control animals,
 24  6 other than animals used for an agricultural purpose (Code
 24  7 section 162.1), by the department of agriculture and land
 24  8 stewardship (DALS).  Commercial establishments include animal
 24  9 shelters, pounds, and research facilities which are required
 24 10 to obtain a certificate of registration; boarding kennels,
 24 11 commercial kennels, and pet shops which are required to
 24 12 obtain a state license; and commercial breeders, dealers, and
 24 13 public auctions which are required to obtain a state license
 24 14 or a permit if licensed by the United States department of
 24 15 agriculture (USDA) (Code section 162.2A).
 24 16    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill refers to each type of
 24 17 commercial establishment as a class and requires that a person
 24 18 operating one or more commercial establishments of the same
 24 19 class obtain a single license. The bill also creates four new
 24 20 types of licenses: (1) a license for grooming facilities,
 24 21 (2) a license for animal rescues, (3) a license for animal
 24 22 sanctuaries, and (4) a special type of commercial breeder's
 24 23 license reserved for a small breeder, competitive show breeder,
 24 24 or specialized breeder.  The bill also recognizes animal foster
 24 25 care homes that temporarily maintain dogs or cats on behalf of
 24 26 animal rescues, animal shelters, and pounds. The bill replaces
 24 27 the current fee system with one that includes the assessment of
 24 28 a base amount and the possible assessment of a scheduled amount
 24 29 based on class.  The moneys from fees are still deposited
 24 30 into the commercial establishment fund. However, an amount
 24 31 is to be transferred to a new animal rescue remediation fund
 24 32 also under the control of DALS.  The bill requires DALS to
 24 33 perform inspections and licensees to maintain records.  The
 24 34 bill provides that DALS may take disciplinary action by
 24 35 suspending or revoking the person's license. It provides
 25  1 that any continuing education program voluntarily completed
 25  2 by a person operating a commercial establishment prior to a
 25  3 disciplinary action is not considered part of such action. The
 25  4 bill provides for the sterilization of dogs or cats that are in
 25  5 the custody of an animal sanctuary. Fees and civil penalties
 25  6 associated with the sterilization requirements are also to be
 25  7 deposited into the animal rescue remediation fund. Finally,
 25  8 it provides that the attorney general or a county attorney may
 25  9 bring a criminal action in order to enforce the provisions
 25 10 of the Code chapter and allows a court to provide injunctive
 25 11 relief.
