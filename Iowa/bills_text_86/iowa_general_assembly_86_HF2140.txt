  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.
 12  2    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains

  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,

 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may

 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the

 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to

 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the

 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to

 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.

 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also

 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene

  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.

  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,

 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also

  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral

  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may

 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily

 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the

 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant

 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to

 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be

 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also

  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a

 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from

  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against

  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital

  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a

 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or

 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,

  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation

  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a

 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or

 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,

  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from

  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.
  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from

  9  5    Sec. 15.  RIGHT OF INTERVENTION.  The general assembly,
  9  6 by joint resolution, may appoint one or more of its members,
  9  7 who sponsored or cosponsored this Act in the member's official
  9  8 capacity to intervene as a matter of right in any case in which
  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.
  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.
 12  2    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital

 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or

 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,

 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  7 26 an unborn infant or bodily remains. Such relief may include
  7 27 all of the following:

  7 29 occasioned by such violation.
  7 30    b.  Statutory damages equal to three times the cost of the
  7 31 pregnant woman's delivery or abortion.
  7 32    c.  A basis for professional disciplinary action under
  7 33 chapter 148.
  7 34    d.  Upon conviction of a violation of this section, the
  7 35 automatic suspension of the license of the physician for at
  8  1 least one year.
  8  2    7.  A person who violates this section is guilty of a class
  8  3 "C" felony for each violation.
  8  4    8.  State funding shall not be appropriated to or expended by
  8  5 any state agency, state institution, or program administered by
  8  6 the state including but not limited to the medical assistance
  8  7 program if such entity or program is found in violation of this

  9  8 capacity to intervene as a matter of right in any case in which
  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.
  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.

  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to

  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily

  9  5    Sec. 15.  RIGHT OF INTERVENTION.  The general assembly,
  9  6 by joint resolution, may appoint one or more of its members,
  9  7 who sponsored or cosponsored this Act in the member's official
  9  8 capacity to intervene as a matter of right in any case in which
  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.
  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  8  3 "C" felony for each violation.
  8  4    8.  State funding shall not be appropriated to or expended by
  8  5 any state agency, state institution, or program administered by
  8  6 the state including but not limited to the medical assistance

  8  8 section.
  8  9    9.  For purposes of this section:
  8 10    a.  "Abortion" means abortion as defined in section 146.1.
  8 11    b.  "Bodily remains" means bodily remains as defined in
  8 12 section 144.1.
  8 13    c.  "Experiment" or "experimentation" means the use of bodily
  8 14 remains in any trial, test, procedure, or observation carried
  8 15 out with the goal of verifying, refuting, or establishing the
  8 16 validity of a hypothesis, but does not include diagnostic or
  8 17 remedial tests, procedures, or observations which have the
  8 18 purpose of determining the life or health of the unborn infant,
  8 19 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or the
  8 20 pregnant woman, or pathological study.

  9  8 capacity to intervene as a matter of right in any case in which
  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene

  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.
  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also

 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the

 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.

 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the

 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.

 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state

  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by

 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to

 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the

 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or

 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,

 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be

 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under

 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or

 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the

 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose

 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than

 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9  4 provisions of this Act are severable.
  9  5    Sec. 15.  RIGHT OF INTERVENTION.  The general assembly,
  9  6 by joint resolution, may appoint one or more of its members,
  9  7 who sponsored or cosponsored this Act in the member's official
  9  8 capacity to intervene as a matter of right in any case in which
  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.
  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from

 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or

 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the

 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant

 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and

  9  8 capacity to intervene as a matter of right in any case in which
  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.
  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9  4 provisions of this Act are severable.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality

  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation

  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a

 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial

  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also

  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a

  9  8 capacity to intervene as a matter of right in any case in which

  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from

 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.

 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.

  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the

 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality

  9  7 who sponsored or cosponsored this Act in the member's official
  9  8 capacity to intervene as a matter of right in any case in which
  9  9 the constitutionality of this Act is challenged.
  9 10    Sec. 16.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed
  9 11 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and
 11 35 defines "unborn infant" as the offspring of a human being from
 12  1 conception until birth.

  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
 10 34    Additionally, under the bill a person is prohibited from
 10 35 using an unborn infant or the bodily remains resulting from
 11  1 an abortion in animal or human research, experimentation,
 11  2 or study, or for transplantation, unless an exception is
 11  3 met. The exceptions include for diagnostic or remedial
 11  4 tests, procedures, or observations which have the purpose
 11  5 of determining the life or health of the unborn infant, or
 11  6 preserving the life or health of the unborn infant or pregnant
 11  7 woman; and for pathological study.
 11  8    The bill provides for civil relief in the form of monetary
 11  9 and statutory damages, professional disciplinary action
 11 10 against a physician, and criminal penalties for failure to
 11 11 comply with the prohibitions relating to buying, selling,
 11 12 or experimentation in regard to an unborn infant or bodily
 11 13 remains.
 11 14    The bill provides that upon conviction of a violation of
 11 15 these prohibitions, a person is guilty of a class "C" felony.
 11 16 A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement of no more
 11 17 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
 11 18 $10,000.
 11 19    The bill provides that state funding shall not be
 11 20 appropriated to or expended by a state institution, state
 11 21 agency, or program administered by the state if the entity or
 11 22 program is found in violation of the prohibitions.
 11 23    The bill provides that nothing in the bill shall be construed
 11 24 to affect existing federal or state law regarding abortion,
 11 25 as creating or recognizing a right to abortion, or to alter
 11 26 generally accepted medical standards.
 11 27    The provisions of the bill are severable and the bill also
 11 28 provides for the right of intervention by members of the
 11 29 general assembly who sponsored or cosponsored the bill in their
 11 30 official capacity, appointed by joint resolution, to intervene
 11 31 as a matter of right in any case in which the constitutionality
 11 32 of the bill is challenged.
 11 33    The bill makes conforming changes in Code chapter 144 to
 11 34 replace the term "fetus" with the term "unborn infant" and

  9 15    This bill relates to fetal deaths and prohibitions against
  9 16 the buying or selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant
  9 17 or bodily remains. The bill includes definitions used in the
  9 18 bill.
  9 19    The bill amends provisions in Code chapter 144 (vital
  9 20 statistics) relating to fetal deaths, and provides that a fetal
  9 21 death certificate is to be filed for all fetal deaths occurring
  9 22 at the stage of an unborn infant's development at which bodily
  9 23 remains are evident, not only for those after a gestation
  9 24 period of 20 completed weeks or greater, or for a dead unborn
  9 25 infant with a weight of 350 grams or more.
  9 26    The bill also establishes a process for the release to a
  9 27 mother or her authorized representative of fetal bodily remains
  9 28 following a fetal death, or in the alternative, provides
  9 29 for the disposition of fetal bodily remains by the funeral
  9 30 director, the individual in charge of the institution where
  9 31 the bodily remains were expulsed or extracted, or by a person
  9 32 assuming responsibility for the bodily remains, in the manner
  9 33 authorized by the woman or her authorized representative.
  9 34 If the fetal death is not a spontaneous termination of
  9 35 pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may only be by burial,
 10  1 interment, or cremation. If the fetal death is a spontaneous
 10  2 termination of pregnancy or a stillbirth, disposition may
 10  3 also be made in accordance with the uniform anatomical gift
 10  4 Act (Code chapter 142C).  Final disposition shall not be by
 10  5 incineration. If final disposition of the bodily remains is
 10  6 by cremation, the medical examiner of the county in which the
 10  7 fetal death occurred is required to sign the authorization
 10  8 for final disposition. If bodily remains are assumed by the
 10  9 mother or her authorized representative, they must secure
 10 10 a burial transit permit as provided in current law under
 10 11 Code section 144.32. Bodily remains may be moved from the
 10 12 place of death to be prepared for final disposition with the
 10 13 consent of the person who certified the death. A permit for
 10 14 final disposition issued under the laws of another state that
 10 15 accompanies bodily remains brought into Iowa is authorization
 10 16 for final disposition of the bodily remains in Iowa. A
 10 17 person who knowingly violates these provisions is guilty of a
 10 18 serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by
 10 19 confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
 10 20 $315 but not more than $1,875.
 10 21    The bill also establishes prohibitions on the buying or
 10 22 selling of or experimentation on an unborn infant or the bodily
 10 23 remains resulting from an abortion. The bill prohibits a
 10 24 person from experimenting upon an unborn infant intended to
 10 25 be aborted unless the experimentation is therapeutic to the
 10 26 unborn infant; performing or offering to perform an abortion
 10 27 if the justification or reason for the abortion is that the
 10 28 bodily remains may be used for animal or human research,
 10 29 experimentation, or transplantation; knowingly selling,
 10 30 transferring, distributing, giving away, accepting, using,
 10 31 or attempting to use an unborn infant or the bodily remains
 10 32 resulting from an abortion; or aiding or abetting any of these
 10 33 prohibited actions.
