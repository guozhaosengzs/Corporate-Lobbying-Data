  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.  The general assembly
  1  2 finds or declares the following:
  1  3    1.  The general assembly finds that the Iowa supreme court
  1  4 has not determined whether a woman has a fundamental right
  1  5 to an abortion under the Constitution of the State of Iowa
  1  6 distinct from any rights afforded by the Constitution of the
  1  7 United States.
  1  8    2.  The general assembly declares that no fundamental right
  1  9 to abortion exists under the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  1 10    3.  Therefore, the general assembly finds that no right to
  1 11 an abortion exists under the Constitution of the State of Iowa
  1 12 that is coextensive with any right to an abortion under the
  1 13 Constitution of the United States as determined by the United
  1 14 States supreme court.
  1 15    4.  The general assembly declares the state's clear interest
  1 16 is in advancing a respect for and the rights of unborn human
  1 17 life at any stage, and in protecting the health and safety of
  1 18 women.
  1 19    5.  Further, the general assembly declares that this state
  1 20 interest outweighs any right to abortion as no such right has
  1 21 been determined by the Iowa supreme court to exist under the
  1 22 Constitution of the State of Iowa or through any coextensive
  1 23 right vaguely linked to a decision of the United States supreme
  1 24 court under the Constitution of the United States.
  1 25    6.  The general assembly declares that the purpose of this
  1 26 Act is to promote respect for and the rights of unborn human
  1 27 life and to protect the health and safety of women.
  1 28    7.  Therefore, the general assembly declares that the
  1 29 strength of the state's justification in enacting this Act
  1 30 outweighs the right of, and does not place an undue burden on
  1 31 or a substantial obstacle in the way of, a woman seeking an
  1 32 abortion.
  1 33    8.  In accordance with Article 5, sections 1 and 4 of the
  1 34 Constitution of the State of Iowa, the general assembly imposes
  1 35 a restriction on the state courts from judicially reviewing
  2  1 this Act.

  1  7 United States.
  1  8    2.  The general assembly declares that no fundamental right
  1  9 to abortion exists under the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  1 10    3.  Therefore, the general assembly finds that no right to

  1 23 right vaguely linked to a decision of the United States supreme
  1 24 court under the Constitution of the United States.
  1 25    6.  The general assembly declares that the purpose of this
  1 26 Act is to promote respect for and the rights of unborn human
  1 27 life and to protect the health and safety of women.
  1 28    7.  Therefore, the general assembly declares that the
  1 29 strength of the state's justification in enacting this Act
  1 30 outweighs the right of, and does not place an undue burden on
  1 31 or a substantial obstacle in the way of, a woman seeking an
  1 32 abortion.

  3 10 supreme court to exist under the Iowa Constitution or through
  3 11 any vague link to a coextensive right determined by the United

  3 15 safety of women; the strength of the state's justification in
  3 16 enacting the bill outweighs the right of, and does not place
  3 17 an undue burden on or a substantial obstacle in the way of,
  3 18 a woman seeking an abortion; and in accordance with Article

  3 27    The bill defines "medical abortion" as the use of a
  3 28 medication including but not limited to mifepristone or
  3 29 ulipristal acetate to terminate a pregnancy.  The bill provides
