  2 33                           EXPLANATION
  2 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  1 This bill extends, from five years to 10 years, the time by
  3  2 which actions may be brought for damages for injury suffered as
  3  3 a result of sexual abuse by a counselor, therapist, or school
  3  4 employee or as a result of sexual exploitation by a counselor,
  3  5 therapist, or school employee. Further, if the victim was a
  3  6 minor when the sexual abuse or exploitation occurred, actions
  3  7 for damages for injury must be brought within 10 years of the
  3  8 date the victim attains the age of 18.  The bill also allows
  3  9 minors one year from and after attainment of age 18 to make a
  3 10 claim for damages based upon an act or omission of an employee
  3 11 of the state or political subdivision.
  3 12    The bill amends the definition of "school employee" in
  3 13 the Code provision that establishes the criminal offense of
  3 14 sexual exploitation by a school employee. Currently under
  3 15 Code section 709.15, "school employee" is defined to include
  3 16 any practitioner or coach who is licensed or authorized by the
  3 17 board of educational examiners. The current definition does
  3 18 not limit employment to a public or nonpublic school. The bill
  3 19 amends the definition to provide that "school employee" means
  3 20 a person who holds a license, certificate, authorization, or
  3 21 statement of professional recognition issued by the board; a
  3 22 person employed by a school district or nonpublic school; a
  3 23 contract employee of a school district or nonpublic school who
  3 24 has significant contact with students enrolled in the school
  3 25 district or nonpublic school; or a person who performs services
  3 26 as a volunteer for a school district or nonpublic school and
  3 27 who has significant contact with students enrolled in the
  3 28 school district or nonpublic school.
  3 29    However, the bill provides that the definition of "school
  3 30 employee" does not include a student enrolled in a school
  3 31 district or nonpublic school, or a person who is a school
  3 32 volunteer or who holds a coaching authorization if such person
  3 33 is less than four years older than the student and is not in
  3 34 a position of direct authority over the student.  Further,
  3 35 the  provisions related to the definition do not apply to a
  4  1 person who is employed by, volunteers for, or is under contract
  4  2 with a school district or nonpublic school if the student is
  4  3 not enrolled in the same school district or nonpublic school
  4  4 that employs the person or for which the person volunteers or
  4  5 is under contract, and the person does not hold a license,
  4  6 certificate, authorization, or statement of professional
  4  7 recognition issued by the board.
  4  8    A person who commits sexual exploitation by a school
  4  9 employee in violation of Code section 709.15(3) commits either
  4 10 an aggravated misdemeanor, which is punishable by confinement
  4 11 for no more than two years and a fine of at least $625 but not
  4 12 more than $6,250; or a class "D" felony, which is punishable by
  4 13 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
  4 14 $750 but not more than $7,500. Such a person must register as a
  4 15 tier II offender on the sex offender registry if the victim is
  4 16 13 years of age or older, or, if the victim is under 13 years
  4 17 of age, as a tier III offender.

  3  9 minors one year from and after attainment of age 18 to make a
  3 10 claim for damages based upon an act or omission of an employee
  3 11 of the state or political subdivision.
  3 12    The bill amends the definition of "school employee" in
  3 13 the Code provision that establishes the criminal offense of
  3 14 sexual exploitation by a school employee. Currently under
  3 15 Code section 709.15, "school employee" is defined to include
  3 16 any practitioner or coach who is licensed or authorized by the
  3 17 board of educational examiners. The current definition does
  3 18 not limit employment to a public or nonpublic school. The bill
  3 19 amends the definition to provide that "school employee" means
  3 20 a person who holds a license, certificate, authorization, or
  3 21 statement of professional recognition issued by the board; a
  3 22 person employed by a school district or nonpublic school; a
  3 23 contract employee of a school district or nonpublic school who
  3 24 has significant contact with students enrolled in the school
  3 25 district or nonpublic school; or a person who performs services
  3 26 as a volunteer for a school district or nonpublic school and
  3 27 who has significant contact with students enrolled in the
  3 28 school district or nonpublic school.
  3 29    However, the bill provides that the definition of "school
  3 30 employee" does not include a student enrolled in a school
  3 31 district or nonpublic school, or a person who is a school
  3 32 volunteer or who holds a coaching authorization if such person
  3 33 is less than four years older than the student and is not in
  3 34 a position of direct authority over the student.  Further,
  3 35 the  provisions related to the definition do not apply to a
  4  1 person who is employed by, volunteers for, or is under contract
  4  2 with a school district or nonpublic school if the student is
  4  3 not enrolled in the same school district or nonpublic school
  4  4 that employs the person or for which the person volunteers or
  4  5 is under contract, and the person does not hold a license,
  4  6 certificate, authorization, or statement of professional
  4  7 recognition issued by the board.
  4  8    A person who commits sexual exploitation by a school
  4  9 employee in violation of Code section 709.15(3) commits either
  4 10 an aggravated misdemeanor, which is punishable by confinement
  4 11 for no more than two years and a fine of at least $625 but not
  4 12 more than $6,250; or a class "D" felony, which is punishable by
  4 13 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least
