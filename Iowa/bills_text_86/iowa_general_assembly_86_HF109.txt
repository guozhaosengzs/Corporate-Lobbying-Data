  2 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 14    This bill establishes a statewide chemical substance abuse
  2 15 monitoring pilot program. The bill allows the department
  2 16 of public health, in collaboration with the department
  2 17 of corrections, to approve applications from counties for
  2 18 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 19 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 20 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 21 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 22 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 23 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 24    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
  2 25 convicted of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to
  2 26 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
  2 27 The programs are to require testing to determine whether a
  2 28 chemical substance is present at least twice per day at a
  2 29 central location where an immediate sanction can be applied or,
  2 30 where such testing is impractical, by continuous transdermal or
  2 31 electronic monitoring. The programs shall also apply sanctions
  2 32 when test results definitively indicate the presence of a
  2 33 chemical substance. The programs shall require participants to
  2 34 pay program costs.
  2 35    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3  1 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3  2 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
  3  3 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2016, or upon the
  3  4 effective date of department rules, whichever is earlier,
  3  5 and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The

  2  6 the results of the pilot programs and make recommendations to
  2  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2017.
  2  8    7.  For the purposes of this section, "chemical substance"
  2  9 means alcohol, wine, spirits, and beer as defined in section
  2 10 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
  2 11                           EXPLANATION
  2 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 14    This bill establishes a statewide chemical substance abuse
  2 15 monitoring pilot program. The bill allows the department
  2 16 of public health, in collaboration with the department
  2 17 of corrections, to approve applications from counties for
  2 18 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 19 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 20 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 21 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 22 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 23 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 24    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
  2 25 convicted of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to
  2 26 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
  2 27 The programs are to require testing to determine whether a
  2 28 chemical substance is present at least twice per day at a
  2 29 central location where an immediate sanction can be applied or,
  2 30 where such testing is impractical, by continuous transdermal or
  2 31 electronic monitoring. The programs shall also apply sanctions
  2 32 when test results definitively indicate the presence of a
  2 33 chemical substance. The programs shall require participants to
  2 34 pay program costs.
  2 35    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3  1 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3  2 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
  3  3 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2016, or upon the
  3  4 effective date of department rules, whichever is earlier,
  3  5 and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The
  3  6 department of public health is to adopt rules to implement the
  3  7 programs, including but not limited to provisions relating to
  3  8 applications for, approval of, costs of, and oversight of the
  3  9 pilot programs and reporting requirements for participating
  3 10 counties. The department of public health is directed to
  3 11 submit a report on the results of the pilot programs and make

  2 10 123.3 and controlled substances as defined in section 124.101.
  2 11                           EXPLANATION
  2 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 14    This bill establishes a statewide chemical substance abuse
  2 15 monitoring pilot program. The bill allows the department
  2 16 of public health, in collaboration with the department
  2 17 of corrections, to approve applications from counties for
  2 18 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 19 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 20 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 21 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 22 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 23 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 24    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
  2 25 convicted of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to
  2 26 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
  2 27 The programs are to require testing to determine whether a
  2 28 chemical substance is present at least twice per day at a
  2 29 central location where an immediate sanction can be applied or,
  2 30 where such testing is impractical, by continuous transdermal or
  2 31 electronic monitoring. The programs shall also apply sanctions
  2 32 when test results definitively indicate the presence of a
  2 33 chemical substance. The programs shall require participants to
  2 34 pay program costs.
  2 35    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3  1 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3  2 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
  3  3 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2016, or upon the
  3  4 effective date of department rules, whichever is earlier,
  3  5 and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The
  3  6 department of public health is to adopt rules to implement the
  3  7 programs, including but not limited to provisions relating to
  3  8 applications for, approval of, costs of, and oversight of the
  3  9 pilot programs and reporting requirements for participating

  2 16 of public health, in collaboration with the department
  2 17 of corrections, to approve applications from counties for
  2 18 countywide chemical substance abuse monitoring pilot programs.
  2 19 The programs are to be available 24 hours per day, seven days
  2 20 per week, in an effort to reduce the number of crimes that have
  2 21 a nexus with chemical substance abuse. "Chemical substance"
  2 22 includes alcohol, wine, spirits, beer, and controlled
  2 23 substances as those terms are defined in the Code.
  2 24    The programs shall require individuals charged with or
  2 25 convicted of a crime involving chemical substance abuse to
  2 26 abstain from all chemical substances for a period of time.
  2 27 The programs are to require testing to determine whether a
  2 28 chemical substance is present at least twice per day at a
  2 29 central location where an immediate sanction can be applied or,
  2 30 where such testing is impractical, by continuous transdermal or
  2 31 electronic monitoring. The programs shall also apply sanctions
  2 32 when test results definitively indicate the presence of a
  2 33 chemical substance. The programs shall require participants to
  2 34 pay program costs.
  2 35    A court in a county that has established a pilot program
  3  1 may order a defendant, as a condition of pretrial release,
  3  2 probation, or bond, to participate in the program. Approved
  3  3 pilot programs shall begin January 15, 2016, or upon the
  3  4 effective date of department rules, whichever is earlier,
  3  5 and shall be conducted for a minimum of one year. The
  3  6 department of public health is to adopt rules to implement the
  3  7 programs, including but not limited to provisions relating to
  3  8 applications for, approval of, costs of, and oversight of the
  3  9 pilot programs and reporting requirements for participating
  3 10 counties. The department of public health is directed to
  3 11 submit a report on the results of the pilot programs and make
