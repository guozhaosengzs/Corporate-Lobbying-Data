  7 24 or an authorized officer thereof, within a participating
  7 25 jurisdiction may, as a condition of bond, sentence, probation,
  7 26 parole, or a work permit, do all of the following:
  7 27    a.  Require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty
  7 28 to, or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol
  7 29 or a controlled substance was a contributing factor in the
  7 30 commission of the crime, including but not limited to a
  7 31 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated in
  7 32 violation of section 321J.2 or 321J.2A, to abstain from alcohol
  7 33 and controlled substances for a period of time.
  7 34    b.  Require the person to be subject to testing to determine
  7 35 whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present in the
  8  1 person's body in the following manner:
  8  2    (1)  At least twice per day at a central location where an
  8  3 immediate sanction can be effectively applied.
  8  4    (2)  Where testing under subparagraph (1) creates a
  8  5 documented hardship or is geographically impractical, by an
  8  6 alternative method approved by the department and consistent
  8  7 with this section where a timely sanction can be effectively
  8  8 applied.
  8  9    2.  The program shall be evidence=based and shall satisfy at
  8 10 least two of the following requirements:
  8 11    a.  The program is included in the United States substance
  8 12 abuse and mental health services administration's national
  8 13 registry of evidence=based programs and practices.
  8 14    b.  The program has been reported in a peer=reviewed journal
  8 15 as having positive effects on the primary targeted outcome.
  8 16    c.  The program has been documented as effective by informed
  8 17 experts and other sources.
  8 18    3.  a.  The core components of the program shall include
  8 19 the use of a primary testing methodology for determining the
  8 20 presence of alcohol or a controlled substance in a person that
  8 21 best facilitates the ability of a law enforcement agency to
  8 22 apply immediate sanctions for failed test results and that is
  8 23 available at an affordable cost.
  8 24    b.  In cases of documented hardship or geographic
  8 25 impracticality, or in cases where a program participant
  8 26 has received less stringent testing requirements, testing
  8 27 methodologies that best facilitate the ability of a law
  8 28 enforcement agency to apply timely sanctions for noncompliant
  8 29 test results may be utilized. For purposes of this section,
  8 30 hardship or geographic impracticality shall be determined by
  8 31 documentation and consideration of the following factors:
  8 32    (1)  Whether a testing device is available.
  8 33    (2)  Whether the participant is capable of paying the fees
  8 34 and costs associated with the testing device.
  8 35    (3)  Whether the participant is capable of wearing the
  9  1 testing device.
  9  2    (4)  Whether the participant fails to qualify for testing
  9  3 twice per day because of one or more of the following:
  9  4    (a)  The participant lives in a rural area and submitting to
  9  5 testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  9  6    (b)  The participant's employment requires the participant's
  9  7 presence at a location remote from the testing location and
  9  8 submitting to testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  9  9    (c)  The participant has repeatedly violated the
  9 10 requirements of the program while submitting to testing twice
  9 11 per day and poses a substantial risk of continuing to violate
  9 12 the requirements of the program.
  9 13    4.  If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program,
  9 14 the department shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and
  9 15 administering the program in that jurisdiction in compliance
  9 16 with this chapter.
  9 17    5.  a.  If a jurisdiction participates in the program, the
  9 18 participating jurisdiction or a law enforcement agency of the
  9 19 participating jurisdiction may designate a third party to
  9 20 provide testing services or to take any other action required
  9 21 or authorized to be provided by the participating jurisdiction
  9 22 or law enforcement agency under this chapter, except a
  9 23 third=party designee shall not determine whether to participate
  9 24 in the program.
  9 25    b.  The participating jurisdiction, in consultation with the
  9 26 law enforcement agency of the participating jurisdiction, shall
  9 27 establish testing locations for the program.
  9 28    6.  Any efforts by the department to alter or modify a core
  9 29 component of the program shall include a documented strategy
  9 30 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
  9 31 alteration or modification. Before the department alters or
  9 32 modifies a core component of the program, a pilot program
  9 33 with defined objectives and timelines shall be initiated, and
  9 34 measurements of the effectiveness and impact of the proposed
  9 35 alteration or modification to a core component shall be
 10  1 monitored. The data shall be assessed and the department
 10  2 shall make a determination as to whether the stated goals of
 10  3 the alteration or modification were achieved and whether the
 10  4 alteration or modification should be formally implemented into
 10  5 the program.

  8  6 alternative method approved by the department and consistent
  8  7 with this section where a timely sanction can be effectively
  8  8 applied.

  8 34 and costs associated with the testing device.
  8 35    (3)  Whether the participant is capable of wearing the
  9  1 testing device.
  9  2    (4)  Whether the participant fails to qualify for testing
  9  3 twice per day because of one or more of the following:
  9  4    (a)  The participant lives in a rural area and submitting to
  9  5 testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  9  6    (b)  The participant's employment requires the participant's
  9  7 presence at a location remote from the testing location and
  9  8 submitting to testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  9  9    (c)  The participant has repeatedly violated the
  9 10 requirements of the program while submitting to testing twice
  9 11 per day and poses a substantial risk of continuing to violate
  9 12 the requirements of the program.

  9 32 modifies a core component of the program, a pilot program
  9 33 with defined objectives and timelines shall be initiated, and
  9 34 measurements of the effectiveness and impact of the proposed
  9 35 alteration or modification to a core component shall be
 10  1 monitored. The data shall be assessed and the department
 10  2 shall make a determination as to whether the stated goals of
 10  3 the alteration or modification were achieved and whether the
 10  4 alteration or modification should be formally implemented into
 10  5 the program.

  8 34 and costs associated with the testing device.
  8 35    (3)  Whether the participant is capable of wearing the
  9  1 testing device.
  9  2    (4)  Whether the participant fails to qualify for testing
  9  3 twice per day because of one or more of the following:
  9  4    (a)  The participant lives in a rural area and submitting to
  9  5 testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  9  6    (b)  The participant's employment requires the participant's
  9  7 presence at a location remote from the testing location and
  9  8 submitting to testing twice per day would be unduly burdensome.
  9  9    (c)  The participant has repeatedly violated the
  9 10 requirements of the program while submitting to testing twice
  9 11 per day and poses a substantial risk of continuing to violate
  9 12 the requirements of the program.

  9 34 measurements of the effectiveness and impact of the proposed
  9 35 alteration or modification to a core component shall be
 10  1 monitored. The data shall be assessed and the department
 10  2 shall make a determination as to whether the stated goals of
 10  3 the alteration or modification were achieved and whether the

  9 33 with defined objectives and timelines shall be initiated, and
  9 34 measurements of the effectiveness and impact of the proposed
  9 35 alteration or modification to a core component shall be
 10  1 monitored. The data shall be assessed and the department
 10  2 shall make a determination as to whether the stated goals of

  9 33 with defined objectives and timelines shall be initiated, and
  9 34 measurements of the effectiveness and impact of the proposed
  9 35 alteration or modification to a core component shall be
 10  1 monitored. The data shall be assessed and the department
 10  2 shall make a determination as to whether the stated goals of
 10  3 the alteration or modification were achieved and whether the

 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw
 18  7 the person's temporary restricted license and reinstate the
 18  8 remainder of the license suspension period.

 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw
 18  7 the person's temporary restricted license and reinstate the
 18  8 remainder of the license suspension period.

 14 30                           EXPLANATION
 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.

 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing

 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless

 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private

 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw

 14 30                           EXPLANATION
 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw
 18  7 the person's temporary restricted license and reinstate the
 18  8 remainder of the license suspension period.

 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned

 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be

 14 30                           EXPLANATION
 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw
 18  7 the person's temporary restricted license and reinstate the
 18  8 remainder of the license suspension period.

 14 30                           EXPLANATION
 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw

 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature

 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw

 14 30                           EXPLANATION
 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.

 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the

 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without

 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the

 14 30                           EXPLANATION
 14 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 33    This bill directs the department of public safety (DPS) to
 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw
 18  7 the person's temporary restricted license and reinstate the
 18  8 remainder of the license suspension period.

 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering

 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a

 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with

 14 34 establish a statewide sobriety and drug monitoring program that
 14 35 is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Under
 15  1 the program, a court or governmental entity, as a condition
 15  2 of bond, sentence, probation, parole, or a work permit, may
 15  3 require a person who has been charged with, pled guilty to,
 15  4 or been convicted of a crime in which the abuse of alcohol or
 15  5 a controlled substance was a contributing factor, including a
 15  6 second or subsequent offense of operating while intoxicated
 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the
 16 13 state.
 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.

 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the

 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.

 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw
 18  7 the person's temporary restricted license and reinstate the
 18  8 remainder of the license suspension period.

 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central

 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is

 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at

 16 14    The bill further requires DPS to provide for and approve
 16 15 the use of a program data management system to be used by DPS
 16 16 and all participating jurisdictions to manage testing, test
 16 17 events, test results, data access, fees, the collection of fee
 16 18 payments, and the submission and collection of any required
 16 19 reports. The bill provides for certain required features of
 16 20 the data management system.
 16 21    A court or a governmental entity in a participating
 16 22 jurisdiction may utilize the program. A court may condition
 16 23 any bond or pretrial release otherwise authorized by law for
 16 24 a person charged with a second or subsequent offense of OWI,
 16 25 or with any crime in which the abuse of alcohol or a controlled
 16 26 substance was a contributing factor, upon participation in the
 16 27 program and payment of the required fees. A court may also
 16 28 condition the granting of a suspended sentence or probation
 16 29 otherwise authorized by law for a person convicted of such a
 16 30 crime upon participation in the program and payment of the
 16 31 required fees.
 16 32    Likewise, the board of parole, the department of
 16 33 corrections, or a parole officer may condition parole otherwise
 16 34 authorized by law for a person convicted of such a crime upon
 16 35 participation in the program and payment of the required fees.
 17  1 The bill requires an order or directive placing a
 17  2 participant in the program to include the type of testing
 17  3 required to be administered and the length of time that the
 17  4 participant is required to remain in the program. At the
 17  5 time of enrollment, a representative of the law enforcement
 17  6 agency of a participating jurisdiction shall enter the
 17  7 participant's information into the data management system. The
 17  8 representative of the agency shall provide the participant with
 17  9 the appropriate materials required by the program, inform the
 17 10 participant that the participant's information may be shared
 17 11 for law enforcement and reporting purposes, and provide the
 17 12 participant with information related to the required testing,
 17 13 procedures, and fees.
 17 14    The bill provides that the law enforcement agency of a
 17 15 participating jurisdiction shall establish and maintain a
 17 16 sobriety program account, and collect the required fees. The
 17 17 law enforcement agency shall distribute a portion of the fees
 17 18 to any participating third=party designee in accordance with
 17 19 the agreement between the agency and the third=party designee,
 17 20 and the remainder of the fees collected shall be deposited
 17 21 in the participating jurisdiction's sobriety program account
 17 22 and shall be used only for the purposes of administering and
 17 23 operating the program.
 17 24    Upon the failure of a participant to submit to or pass a
 17 25 test under the program, a peace officer, probation officer, or
 17 26 parole officer shall complete a written statement establishing
 17 27 that the participant, in the judgment of the officer, violated
 17 28 a condition of release or a condition of the program by failing
 17 29 to submit to or pass a test.
 17 30    A peace officer shall immediately arrest the person without
 17 31 a warrant after completing or receiving the written statement.
 17 32 A person taken into custody shall appear before a court within
 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw
 18  7 the person's temporary restricted license and reinstate the
 18  8 remainder of the license suspension period.

 15  7 (OWI), to abstain from alcohol and controlled substances for
 15  8 a period of time.
 15  9    The program requires a person to be subject to testing to
 15 10 determine whether alcohol or a controlled substance is present
 15 11 in the person's body at least twice per day at a central
 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.
 15 25    The bill requires the program to be evidence=based.
 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be
 16  1 initiated and monitored.
 16  2    The bill allows DPS to adopt rules providing for the nature
 16  3 and manner of testing, establishing reasonable fees, providing
 16  4 for the application, acceptance, and use of public and private
 16  5 grants, gifts, and donations, establishing a process for the
 16  6 identification and management of indigent participants, and
 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at
 16 10 an amount such that the fees collected in a participating
 16 11 jurisdiction are sufficient to pay for the costs of the program
 16 12 in the participating jurisdiction, including all costs to the

 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw

 15 12 location where an immediate sanction can be applied. Where
 15 13 such testing creates a documented hardship or is geographically
 15 14 impractical, an alternative method approved by DPS may be used.
 15 15    Hardship or geographic impracticality is determined by
 15 16 documentation and consideration of whether a testing device is
 15 17 available, whether the participant is capable of paying the
 15 18 fees and costs associated with the testing device, whether
 15 19 the participant is capable of wearing the testing device, and
 15 20 whether the participant fails to qualify for testing twice
 15 21 per day because the participant lives in a rural area, the
 15 22 participant's employment requires the participant's presence at
 15 23 a location remote from the testing location, or the participant
 15 24 has repeatedly violated the requirements of the program.

 16  7 providing for the creation and administration of a stakeholder
 16  8 group to review and recommend changes to the program.
 16  9    The bill requires the amount of the fees to be set at

 15 26    If a jurisdiction chooses to participate in the program, DPS
 15 27 shall assist the jurisdiction in setting up and administering
 15 28 the program. The participating jurisdiction shall establish
 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned
 15 34 alteration or modification. Before the core components of the
 15 35 program can be altered or modified, a pilot program must be

 15 29 testing locations and may designate a third party to provide
 15 30 testing services.
 15 31    Any efforts by DPS to alter or modify the core components
 15 32 of the program are required to include a documented strategy
 15 33 for achieving and measuring the effectiveness of the planned

 17 33 a reasonable amount of time and shall not be released unless
 17 34 the person has made a personal appearance before a court.
 17 35    The bill provides that as an alternative to the installation
 18  1 of an ignition interlock device, a temporary restricted license
 18  2 for a person convicted of a second or subsequent OWI may be
 18  3 conditioned on participation in the program. Upon the failure
 18  4 of a participant to submit to or pass a test under the program,
 18  5 the court may notify the department of transportation (DOT)
 18  6 of the person's noncompliance and direct the DOT to withdraw
