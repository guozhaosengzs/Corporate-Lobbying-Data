  1  1 A Resolution supporting an enhanced trade relationship
  1  2    between Iowa and Cuba.
  1  3    WHEREAS, Iowa leads the nation in corn production,
  1  4 pork production, and egg production, and is second
  1  5 in the nation in soybean production and red meat
  1  6 production; and
  1  7    WHEREAS, Iowa is home to approximately one=third of
  1  8 the 100 largest food manufacturers or processors in the
  1  9 United States and Canada and the food industry accounts
  1 10 for approximately one=quarter of Iowa's manufacturing
  1 11 and employs more than 50,000 Iowans; and
  1 12    WHEREAS, enhancing trade with Cuba would create a
  1 13 huge potential market for Iowa farmers and producers as
  1 14 Cuba relies on imports for approximately 80 percent of
  1 15 its food and the demand for food products, especially
  1 16 meat, will increase as economic conditions improve in
  1 17 Cuba; and
  1 18    WHEREAS, advanced manufacturing drives Iowa's
  1 19 economy and is Iowa's largest industry with just under
  1 20 14 percent of Iowa's total employment resulting from
  1 21 manufacturing positions; and
  1 22    WHEREAS, enhancing trade with Cuba could increase
  1 23 the need for advanced manufacturing products as Cuba
  1 24 maintains extensive functional antique automobile and
  1 25 farm machinery collections, which farm machinery will
  1 26 need to be replaced as Cuba takes steps to privatize
  1 27 more of its agricultural land; and
  1 28    WHEREAS, Iowa has a long history of positive
  2  1 interaction with nondemocratic political nations to the
  2  2 benefit of Iowa's business interests without embracing
  2  3 those nations' political structures; and
  2  4    WHEREAS, such positive interaction was demonstrated
  2  5 when Iowa received the Union of Soviet Socialist
  2  6 Republics Premier, Nikita Khrushchev in 1959, and in
  2  7 the positive relationship Iowa currently maintains with
  2  8 President Xi Jinping, the president of the People's
  2  9 Republic of China; and
  2 10    WHEREAS, Cuba has a population of over 11 million
  2 11 people relying on imports for food, manufacturing,
  2 12 and production commodities, and increased trade could
  2 13 further Iowa's market opportunities while allowing
  2 14 the Cuban people to have access to better quality
  2 15 food, better machinery, better technology, and a more
  2 16 positive relationship with a democratic nation; NOW
  2 17 THEREFORE,
  2 18    BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE, That the Senate
  2 19 supports efforts to lessen and eliminate trade
  2 20 restrictions to Cuba; and
  2 21    BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Senate supports an
  2 22 enhanced trade relationship between Iowa and Cuba for
