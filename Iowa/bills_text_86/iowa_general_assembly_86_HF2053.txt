  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies

  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized

  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8

  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside

  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,

  5 20 agency to develop a strategy to make available, on an ongoing
  5 21 basis for research, personally identifiable student data that
  5 22 results from services provided by the entity to the state.
  5 23    The department shall notify the governor and the general
  5 24 assembly annually of changes to existing student data
  5 25 collections maintained by the department. Unless specifically
  5 26 authorized by the general assembly and approved by the
  5 27 governor, changes that are not necessitated by changes in state
  5 28 and federal reporting requirements shall not be implemented.
  5 29    The new provisions relating to student data shall not be
  5 30 construed to undermine or eliminate the right of a student's
  5 31 parent or guardian to review, correct, amend, add to, or delete
  5 32 the student's information on the department's database, or the
  5 33 student's future right as an adult to review, correct, amend,
  5 34 add to, or delete the student's information on the department's
  5 35 database; or construed to supersede any existing open records

  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both

  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such

  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student

  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in

  5 28 and federal reporting requirements shall not be implemented.
  5 29    The new provisions relating to student data shall not be
  5 30 construed to undermine or eliminate the right of a student's

  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies

  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and

  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such

  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,

  5 16 any entity that has an agreement with any federal governmental
  5 17 agency or with a third party that has an agreement with any
  5 18 federal governmental agency, to share personally identifiable

  5 20 agency to develop a strategy to make available, on an ongoing
  5 21 basis for research, personally identifiable student data that
  5 22 results from services provided by the entity to the state.
  5 23    The department shall notify the governor and the general
  5 24 assembly annually of changes to existing student data
  5 25 collections maintained by the department. Unless specifically
  5 26 authorized by the general assembly and approved by the
  5 27 governor, changes that are not necessitated by changes in state
  5 28 and federal reporting requirements shall not be implemented.
  5 29    The new provisions relating to student data shall not be
  5 30 construed to undermine or eliminate the right of a student's
  5 31 parent or guardian to review, correct, amend, add to, or delete
  5 32 the student's information on the department's database, or the
  5 33 student's future right as an adult to review, correct, amend,

  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved

  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both

  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa

  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or

  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.

  3 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such

  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,

  3 24                           EXPLANATION
  3 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such
  4 17 rules unless specifically authorized by the general assembly
  4 18 and the governor.

  4 20 requires the department to establish policies for student
  4 21 data collection, and to annually conduct an inventory of and
  4 22 categorize the data collected on students and the purposes
  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,

  3 11 general assembly annually of changes in measures to collect
  3 12 student data or to maintain student data collections by the
  3 13 department which are required for any reason, including changes
  3 14 in federal reporting requirements. Such change shall not be
  3 15 implemented by the department unless specifically authorized by
  3 16 a constitutional majority of each house of the general assembly
  3 17 and approved by the governor or unless otherwise specifically
  3 18 authorized by statute.
  3 19    9.  Student data shall not be published, or shared outside
  3 20 the state, by the department except in aggregate form.
  3 21    10.  This section shall not be construed to supersede any

  3 24                           EXPLANATION
  3 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such
  4 17 rules unless specifically authorized by the general assembly
  4 18 and the governor.
  4 19    STUDENT DATA COLLECTION == POLICIES AND PLANS.  The bill
  4 20 requires the department to establish policies for student
  4 21 data collection, and to annually conduct an inventory of and
  4 22 categorize the data collected on students and the purposes
  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,
  5 10 280.25, 280.29, and 299A.11.
  5 11    The department must establish and maintain a policy relating
  5 12 to the sharing, security, and confidentiality of student data
  5 13 in compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights
  5 14 and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. {1232g.  The state board and the
  5 15 department are prohibited from entering into an agreement with
  5 16 any entity that has an agreement with any federal governmental
  5 17 agency or with a third party that has an agreement with any
  5 18 federal governmental agency, to share personally identifiable
  5 19 student data, or that is working with any federal governmental
  5 20 agency to develop a strategy to make available, on an ongoing
  5 21 basis for research, personally identifiable student data that
  5 22 results from services provided by the entity to the state.
  5 23    The department shall notify the governor and the general
  5 24 assembly annually of changes to existing student data
  5 25 collections maintained by the department. Unless specifically
  5 26 authorized by the general assembly and approved by the
  5 27 governor, changes that are not necessitated by changes in state
  5 28 and federal reporting requirements shall not be implemented.
  5 29    The new provisions relating to student data shall not be
  5 30 construed to undermine or eliminate the right of a student's
  5 31 parent or guardian to review, correct, amend, add to, or delete
  5 32 the student's information on the department's database, or the
  5 33 student's future right as an adult to review, correct, amend,
  5 34 add to, or delete the student's information on the department's
  5 35 database; or construed to supersede any existing open records
  6  1 law provisions, provisions relating to the department's
  6  2 comprehensive management information system which are in
  6  3 compliance with state and federal reporting requirements, or
  6  4 provisions enacting the interstate compact on educational
  6  5 opportunity for military children.

  3 19    9.  Student data shall not be published, or shared outside
  3 20 the state, by the department except in aggregate form.
  3 21    10.  This section shall not be construed to supersede any
  3 22 provision of section 22.7, section 256.9, subsection 48, or

  3 24                           EXPLANATION
  3 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such
  4 17 rules unless specifically authorized by the general assembly
  4 18 and the governor.
  4 19    STUDENT DATA COLLECTION == POLICIES AND PLANS.  The bill
  4 20 requires the department to establish policies for student
  4 21 data collection, and to annually conduct an inventory of and
  4 22 categorize the data collected on students and the purposes
  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,
  5 10 280.25, 280.29, and 299A.11.
  5 11    The department must establish and maintain a policy relating
  5 12 to the sharing, security, and confidentiality of student data
  5 13 in compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights
  5 14 and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. {1232g.  The state board and the
  5 15 department are prohibited from entering into an agreement with
  5 16 any entity that has an agreement with any federal governmental
  5 17 agency or with a third party that has an agreement with any
  5 18 federal governmental agency, to share personally identifiable
  5 19 student data, or that is working with any federal governmental
  5 20 agency to develop a strategy to make available, on an ongoing
  5 21 basis for research, personally identifiable student data that
  5 22 results from services provided by the entity to the state.
  5 23    The department shall notify the governor and the general
  5 24 assembly annually of changes to existing student data
  5 25 collections maintained by the department. Unless specifically
  5 26 authorized by the general assembly and approved by the
  5 27 governor, changes that are not necessitated by changes in state
  5 28 and federal reporting requirements shall not be implemented.
  5 29    The new provisions relating to student data shall not be
  5 30 construed to undermine or eliminate the right of a student's
  5 31 parent or guardian to review, correct, amend, add to, or delete
  5 32 the student's information on the department's database, or the
  5 33 student's future right as an adult to review, correct, amend,
  5 34 add to, or delete the student's information on the department's
  5 35 database; or construed to supersede any existing open records
  6  1 law provisions, provisions relating to the department's
  6  2 comprehensive management information system which are in
  6  3 compliance with state and federal reporting requirements, or
  6  4 provisions enacting the interstate compact on educational

  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such
  4 17 rules unless specifically authorized by the general assembly
  4 18 and the governor.
  4 19    STUDENT DATA COLLECTION == POLICIES AND PLANS.  The bill
  4 20 requires the department to establish policies for student
  4 21 data collection, and to annually conduct an inventory of and
  4 22 categorize the data collected on students and the purposes
  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,
  5 10 280.25, 280.29, and 299A.11.
  5 11    The department must establish and maintain a policy relating
  5 12 to the sharing, security, and confidentiality of student data
  5 13 in compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights
  5 14 and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. {1232g.  The state board and the
  5 15 department are prohibited from entering into an agreement with
  5 16 any entity that has an agreement with any federal governmental
  5 17 agency or with a third party that has an agreement with any
  5 18 federal governmental agency, to share personally identifiable
  5 19 student data, or that is working with any federal governmental
  5 20 agency to develop a strategy to make available, on an ongoing
  5 21 basis for research, personally identifiable student data that
  5 22 results from services provided by the entity to the state.
  5 23    The department shall notify the governor and the general
  5 24 assembly annually of changes to existing student data
  5 25 collections maintained by the department. Unless specifically
  5 26 authorized by the general assembly and approved by the
  5 27 governor, changes that are not necessitated by changes in state
  5 28 and federal reporting requirements shall not be implemented.
  5 29    The new provisions relating to student data shall not be
  5 30 construed to undermine or eliminate the right of a student's
  5 31 parent or guardian to review, correct, amend, add to, or delete
  5 32 the student's information on the department's database, or the
  5 33 student's future right as an adult to review, correct, amend,

  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general

  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in

  3 24                           EXPLANATION
  3 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such
  4 17 rules unless specifically authorized by the general assembly
  4 18 and the governor.
  4 19    STUDENT DATA COLLECTION == POLICIES AND PLANS.  The bill
  4 20 requires the department to establish policies for student
  4 21 data collection, and to annually conduct an inventory of and
  4 22 categorize the data collected on students and the purposes
  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,
  5 10 280.25, 280.29, and 299A.11.

  5 14 and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. {1232g.  The state board and the
  5 15 department are prohibited from entering into an agreement with
  5 16 any entity that has an agreement with any federal governmental
  5 17 agency or with a third party that has an agreement with any
  5 18 federal governmental agency, to share personally identifiable
  5 19 student data, or that is working with any federal governmental
  5 20 agency to develop a strategy to make available, on an ongoing
  5 21 basis for research, personally identifiable student data that
  5 22 results from services provided by the entity to the state.
  5 23    The department shall notify the governor and the general
  5 24 assembly annually of changes to existing student data
  5 25 collections maintained by the department. Unless specifically
  5 26 authorized by the general assembly and approved by the
  5 27 governor, changes that are not necessitated by changes in state
  5 28 and federal reporting requirements shall not be implemented.
  5 29    The new provisions relating to student data shall not be
  5 30 construed to undermine or eliminate the right of a student's
  5 31 parent or guardian to review, correct, amend, add to, or delete
  5 32 the student's information on the department's database, or the
  5 33 student's future right as an adult to review, correct, amend,
  5 34 add to, or delete the student's information on the department's
  5 35 database; or construed to supersede any existing open records
  6  1 law provisions, provisions relating to the department's

  3 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such
  4 17 rules unless specifically authorized by the general assembly

  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,

  5 15 department are prohibited from entering into an agreement with
  5 16 any entity that has an agreement with any federal governmental
  5 17 agency or with a third party that has an agreement with any
  5 18 federal governmental agency, to share personally identifiable

  5 22 results from services provided by the entity to the state.
  5 23    The department shall notify the governor and the general
  5 24 assembly annually of changes to existing student data
  5 25 collections maintained by the department. Unless specifically
  5 26 authorized by the general assembly and approved by the
  5 27 governor, changes that are not necessitated by changes in state
  5 28 and federal reporting requirements shall not be implemented.
  5 29    The new provisions relating to student data shall not be
  5 30 construed to undermine or eliminate the right of a student's
  5 31 parent or guardian to review, correct, amend, add to, or delete
  5 32 the student's information on the department's database, or the
  5 33 student's future right as an adult to review, correct, amend,

  3 24                           EXPLANATION
  3 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 27    This bill relates to statewide student assessments and
  3 28 student data collection by the department of education,
  3 29 school districts, and accredited nonpublic schools. The bill
  3 30 requires the department to create student data=related policies
  3 31 and plans, and also requires that changes proposed by the
  3 32 department relating to the statewide assessment or to student
  3 33 data collection or maintenance must be specifically authorized
  3 34 by the general assembly and approved by the governor.
  3 35    ASSESSMENTS.  Currently, Code section 256.7(21) requires the
  4  1 state board of education to specify in rule that the approved
  4  2 district=wide assessment of student progress administered for
  4  3 purposes of the core academic indicators in mathematics and
  4  4 reading in grades 4, 8, and 11, and for science in grades 8
  4  5 and 11, must be the Iowa assessments.  However, for the school
  4  6 year beginning July 1, 2016, and each succeeding school year,
  4  7 the rules must provide that the assessment at a minimum must
  4  8 also be aligned with the Iowa common core standards in both
  4  9 content and rigor; accurately describe student achievement and
  4 10 growth for purposes of the school, the school district, and
  4 11 state accountability systems; and provide valid, reliable, and
  4 12 fair measures of student progress toward college or career
  4 13 readiness. Under the bill, if the state board proposes rules
  4 14 providing for a statewide assessment other than the Iowa
  4 15 assessments, it must submit the proposed rules to the general
  4 16 assembly, and the state board is prohibited from adopting such
  4 17 rules unless specifically authorized by the general assembly
  4 18 and the governor.
  4 19    STUDENT DATA COLLECTION == POLICIES AND PLANS.  The bill
  4 20 requires the department to establish policies for student
  4 21 data collection, and to annually conduct an inventory of and
  4 22 categorize the data collected on students and the purposes
  4 23 for which the data is collected, and report its findings and
  4 24 recommendations to the general assembly by November 1, 2016,
  4 25 and by November 1 each succeeding year.
  4 26    The department must also create a detailed student
  4 27 data security plan, a data breach plan, data retention or
  4 28 destruction plans, and guidelines for authorizing student and
  4 29 parental access to student data.
  4 30    The bill prohibits the department, school districts, and
  4 31 accredited nonpublic schools from including in student data
  4 32 files certain information regarding biometrics, psychometrics,
  4 33 and health; certain information concerning the student's or the
  4 34 student's family; and further prohibits the department from
  4 35 publishing student data, and from sharing student data outside
  5  1 the state, except in aggregate form.
  5  2    Student data must be kept confidential unless otherwise
  5  3 ordered by a court, by the lawful custodian of the records, or
  5  4 by another person duly authorized to release such information.
  5  5 The bill allows student data to be provided outside of the
  5  6 state if necessary to facilitate the timely enrollment and
  5  7 placement of a student who is transferring to an out=of=state
  5  8 school. Similar provisions are currently provided for in
  5  9 Code chapters 22 and 256H, and Code sections 279.9A, 280.19A,
  5 10 280.25, 280.29, and 299A.11.
  5 11    The department must establish and maintain a policy relating
  5 12 to the sharing, security, and confidentiality of student data
  5 13 in compliance with the federal Family Educational Rights
  5 14 and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. {1232g.  The state board and the
  5 15 department are prohibited from entering into an agreement with
  5 16 any entity that has an agreement with any federal governmental
  5 17 agency or with a third party that has an agreement with any
  5 18 federal governmental agency, to share personally identifiable
