  5 25 and care management. Medical necessity determinations and
  5 26 care management for the treatment of eating disorders must

  5 28 individual diagnosed with the disorder; not be based solely
  5 29 on the weight of the individual diagnosed with the disorder;

  4 23    This bill provides that a policy, contract, or plan

  4 33 definitions provided in the most recent edition of the American
  4 34 psychiatric association's diagnostic and statistical manual of
  4 35 mental disorders.
  5  1 Coverage required by the bill is limited to medically
  5  2 necessary diagnostic assessment and treatment of eating
  5  3 disorders in accordance with a treatment plan, that is
  5  4 provided by a licensed physician, psychiatrist, psychologist,

  5  7 scope of practice.  The treatment plan must include a

  5 13    Coverage required is subject to copayment, deductible, and
  5 14 coinsurance provisions, and any other general exclusions or
  5 15 limitations of a policy, contract, or plan to the same extent

  5 24 care services, which include reviews of medical necessity
  5 25 and care management. Medical necessity determinations and
  5 26 care management for the treatment of eating disorders must

  5 29 on the weight of the individual diagnosed with the disorder;
