  6 10    Sec. 9.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to common interest
  6 11 communities created prior to, and still in existence on, July

  6 13                           EXPLANATION
  6 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 16    This bill relates to the ability of a common interest
  6 17 community to revive lapsed use restrictions.
  6 18    The bill defines "common interest community" as real
  6 19 estate described in a declaration with respect to which a
  6 20 person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a parcel, is
  6 21 obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance
  6 22 premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services or other
  6 23 expenses related to, common elements, other parcels, or other
  6 24 real estate described in the declaration. "Common interest
  6 25 community" includes a cooperative under Code chapter 499A and a
  6 26 horizontal property regime under Code chapter 499B.
  6 27    The bill references the definition of "use restriction" in
  6 28 Code section 614.24, which is a limitation or prohibition on
  6 29 the rights of a landowner to make use of the landowner's real
  6 30 estate, including limitations or prohibitions on commercial
  6 31 uses, rental use, parking and storage of recreational vehicles
  6 32 and their attachments, ownership of pets, outdoor domestic
  6 33 uses, construction and use of accessory structures, building
  6 34 dimensions and colors, building construction materials, and
  6 35 landscaping. "Use restriction" does not include an easement
  7  1 granting a person an affirmative right to use land in the
  7  2 possession of another person, including but not limited to an
  7  3 easement for pedestrian or vehicular access, reasonable ingress
  7  4 and egress, solar access, utilities, supporting utilities,
  7  5 parking areas, bicycle paths, and water flow, an agreement
  7  6 between two or more parcel owners providing for the sharing of
  7  7 costs and other obligations for real estate taxes, insurance
  7  8 premiums, and for maintenance, repair, improvements, services,
  7  9 or other costs related to two or more parcels of real estate
  7 10 regardless of whether the parties to the agreement are owners
  7 11 of individual lots or incorporated or unincorporated lots
  7 12 or have ownership interests in common areas in a horizontal
  7 13 property regime or residential housing development, or an
  7 14 agreement between two or more parcel owners for the joint use
  7 15 and maintenance of driveways, party walls, landscaping, fences,
  7 16 wells, roads, common areas, waterways, or bodies of water.
  7 17    Under Code section 614.24, an action arising or existing
  7 18 by reason of the provisions of any contract providing for use
  7 19 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 20 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 21 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within
  7 22 the 21=year period. Therefore, if a homeowners' association
  7 23 or other claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a
  7 24 common interest community's declaration before the expiration
  7 25 of the 21=year period, the use restrictions in the declaration
  7 26 become unenforceable.
  7 27    The bill enacts new Code chapter 564B to provide a mechanism
  7 28 for common interest communities to revive use restrictions
  7 29 which have become barred by operation of Code section 614.24.
  7 30 A proposal to revive use restrictions may be brought by the
  7 31 executive board of the homeowners' association or by petition
  7 32 of parcel owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected
  7 33 parcels.
  7 34    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive board
  7 35 shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for the
  8  1 revival of use restrictions. The proposal may be voted upon at
  8  2 a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and no more
  8  3 than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel owners.
  8  4 The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot. If the
  8  5 vote is by written ballot, the notice must specify when ballots
  8  6 are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no later than
  8  7 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  8    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  9 affected parcels in the common interest community approve the
  8 10 revival of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use restrictions
  8 11 are revived as to all parcels in the common interest community.
  8 12    The revived use restrictions become effective upon
  8 13 recordation. The revived use restrictions are not given
  8 14 retroactive applicability. Revived use restrictions may not be
  8 15 enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made a good=faith
  8 16 investment that would be impaired by such enforcement and such
  8 17 investment was made while the use restriction was unenforceable
  8 18 under Code section 614.24 and before the use restriction was
  8 19 revived under new Code chapter 564B.
  8 20    The bill provides that if use restrictions are revived under
  8 21 new Code chapter 564B, the 21=year limitation period under Code
  8 22 chapter 614.24 begins as of the recordation date of the revived
  8 23 use restrictions.
  8 24    The bill applies to common interest communities created
  8 25 prior to, and still in existence on, July 1, 2016, and created
  8 26 on or after July 1, 2016.

  7 19 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 20 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 21 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within
  7 22 the 21=year period. Therefore, if a homeowners' association
  7 23 or other claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a

  7 31 executive board of the homeowners' association or by petition
  7 32 of parcel owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected
  7 33 parcels.
  7 34    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive board
  7 35 shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for the
  8  1 revival of use restrictions. The proposal may be voted upon at
  8  2 a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and no more
  8  3 than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel owners.
  8  4 The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot. If the
  8  5 vote is by written ballot, the notice must specify when ballots
  8  6 are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no later than
  8  7 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  8    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  9 affected parcels in the common interest community approve the
  8 10 revival of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use restrictions
  8 11 are revived as to all parcels in the common interest community.
  8 12    The revived use restrictions become effective upon
  8 13 recordation. The revived use restrictions are not given
  8 14 retroactive applicability. Revived use restrictions may not be
  8 15 enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made a good=faith
  8 16 investment that would be impaired by such enforcement and such
  8 17 investment was made while the use restriction was unenforceable
  8 18 under Code section 614.24 and before the use restriction was

  6 31 uses, rental use, parking and storage of recreational vehicles
  6 32 and their attachments, ownership of pets, outdoor domestic
  6 33 uses, construction and use of accessory structures, building
  6 34 dimensions and colors, building construction materials, and

  8  6 are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no later than
  8  7 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  8    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  9 affected parcels in the common interest community approve the
  8 10 revival of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use restrictions
  8 11 are revived as to all parcels in the common interest community.
  8 12    The revived use restrictions become effective upon

  8 14 retroactive applicability. Revived use restrictions may not be
  8 15 enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made a good=faith

  6 31 uses, rental use, parking and storage of recreational vehicles
  6 32 and their attachments, ownership of pets, outdoor domestic
  6 33 uses, construction and use of accessory structures, building
  6 34 dimensions and colors, building construction materials, and
  6 35 landscaping. "Use restriction" does not include an easement
  7  1 granting a person an affirmative right to use land in the
  7  2 possession of another person, including but not limited to an
  7  3 easement for pedestrian or vehicular access, reasonable ingress
  7  4 and egress, solar access, utilities, supporting utilities,

  7  6 between two or more parcel owners providing for the sharing of

  7 20 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 21 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within
  7 22 the 21=year period. Therefore, if a homeowners' association
  7 23 or other claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a
  7 24 common interest community's declaration before the expiration
  7 25 of the 21=year period, the use restrictions in the declaration
  7 26 become unenforceable.

  7 28 for common interest communities to revive use restrictions
  7 29 which have become barred by operation of Code section 614.24.
  7 30 A proposal to revive use restrictions may be brought by the
  7 31 executive board of the homeowners' association or by petition
  7 32 of parcel owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected
  7 33 parcels.
  7 34    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive board
  7 35 shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for the
  8  1 revival of use restrictions. The proposal may be voted upon at
  8  2 a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and no more
  8  3 than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel owners.
  8  4 The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot. If the

  8  6 are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no later than
  8  7 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  8    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  9 affected parcels in the common interest community approve the
  8 10 revival of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use restrictions
  8 11 are revived as to all parcels in the common interest community.
  8 12    The revived use restrictions become effective upon
  8 13 recordation. The revived use restrictions are not given
  8 14 retroactive applicability. Revived use restrictions may not be
  8 15 enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made a good=faith
  8 16 investment that would be impaired by such enforcement and such
  8 17 investment was made while the use restriction was unenforceable
  8 18 under Code section 614.24 and before the use restriction was
  8 19 revived under new Code chapter 564B.
  8 20    The bill provides that if use restrictions are revived under
  8 21 new Code chapter 564B, the 21=year limitation period under Code
  8 22 chapter 614.24 begins as of the recordation date of the revived
  8 23 use restrictions.

  6 16    This bill relates to the ability of a common interest
  6 17 community to revive lapsed use restrictions.
  6 18    The bill defines "common interest community" as real
  6 19 estate described in a declaration with respect to which a
  6 20 person, by virtue of the person's ownership of a parcel, is
  6 21 obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes, insurance
  6 22 premiums, maintenance, or improvement of, or services or other

  6 24 real estate described in the declaration. "Common interest
  6 25 community" includes a cooperative under Code chapter 499A and a
  6 26 horizontal property regime under Code chapter 499B.
  6 27    The bill references the definition of "use restriction" in
  6 28 Code section 614.24, which is a limitation or prohibition on
  6 29 the rights of a landowner to make use of the landowner's real

  7 15 and maintenance of driveways, party walls, landscaping, fences,

  7 17    Under Code section 614.24, an action arising or existing
  7 18 by reason of the provisions of any contract providing for use
  7 19 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 20 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 21 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within

  7 23 or other claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a
  7 24 common interest community's declaration before the expiration
  7 25 of the 21=year period, the use restrictions in the declaration
  7 26 become unenforceable.

  7 28 for common interest communities to revive use restrictions
  7 29 which have become barred by operation of Code section 614.24.
  7 30 A proposal to revive use restrictions may be brought by the
  7 31 executive board of the homeowners' association or by petition
  7 32 of parcel owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected
  7 33 parcels.
  7 34    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive board
  7 35 shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for the
  8  1 revival of use restrictions. The proposal may be voted upon at
  8  2 a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and no more
  8  3 than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel owners.
  8  4 The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot. If the
  8  5 vote is by written ballot, the notice must specify when ballots
  8  6 are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no later than
  8  7 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  8    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  9 affected parcels in the common interest community approve the
  8 10 revival of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use restrictions
  8 11 are revived as to all parcels in the common interest community.
  8 12    The revived use restrictions become effective upon
  8 13 recordation. The revived use restrictions are not given
  8 14 retroactive applicability. Revived use restrictions may not be
  8 15 enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made a good=faith
  8 16 investment that would be impaired by such enforcement and such
  8 17 investment was made while the use restriction was unenforceable
  8 18 under Code section 614.24 and before the use restriction was
  8 19 revived under new Code chapter 564B.
  8 20    The bill provides that if use restrictions are revived under

  8 22 chapter 614.24 begins as of the recordation date of the revived

  6 30 estate, including limitations or prohibitions on commercial
  6 31 uses, rental use, parking and storage of recreational vehicles
  6 32 and their attachments, ownership of pets, outdoor domestic
  6 33 uses, construction and use of accessory structures, building
  6 34 dimensions and colors, building construction materials, and
  6 35 landscaping. "Use restriction" does not include an easement
  7  1 granting a person an affirmative right to use land in the
  7  2 possession of another person, including but not limited to an
  7  3 easement for pedestrian or vehicular access, reasonable ingress
  7  4 and egress, solar access, utilities, supporting utilities,
  7  5 parking areas, bicycle paths, and water flow, an agreement
  7  6 between two or more parcel owners providing for the sharing of
  7  7 costs and other obligations for real estate taxes, insurance
  7  8 premiums, and for maintenance, repair, improvements, services,
  7  9 or other costs related to two or more parcels of real estate

  7 19 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 20 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 21 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within
  7 22 the 21=year period. Therefore, if a homeowners' association
  7 23 or other claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a

  7 29 which have become barred by operation of Code section 614.24.
  7 30 A proposal to revive use restrictions may be brought by the
  7 31 executive board of the homeowners' association or by petition
  7 32 of parcel owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected
  7 33 parcels.
  7 34    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive board
  7 35 shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for the
  8  1 revival of use restrictions. The proposal may be voted upon at
  8  2 a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and no more
  8  3 than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel owners.
  8  4 The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot. If the

  8  9 affected parcels in the common interest community approve the

  8 12    The revived use restrictions become effective upon
  8 13 recordation. The revived use restrictions are not given
  8 14 retroactive applicability. Revived use restrictions may not be
  8 15 enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made a good=faith

  7 17    Under Code section 614.24, an action arising or existing
  7 18 by reason of the provisions of any contract providing for use
  7 19 restrictions in and to real estate may not be maintained after
  7 20 21 years from the recording of the contract unless a claimant
  7 21 has filed a verified claim with the county recorder within
  7 22 the 21=year period. Therefore, if a homeowners' association
  7 23 or other claimant does not file a verified claim regarding a
  7 24 common interest community's declaration before the expiration
  7 25 of the 21=year period, the use restrictions in the declaration
  7 26 become unenforceable.
  7 27    The bill enacts new Code chapter 564B to provide a mechanism
  7 28 for common interest communities to revive use restrictions
  7 29 which have become barred by operation of Code section 614.24.
  7 30 A proposal to revive use restrictions may be brought by the
  7 31 executive board of the homeowners' association or by petition
  7 32 of parcel owners who own at least 10 percent of the affected
  7 33 parcels.
  7 34    The bill specifies the form of the notice the executive board
  7 35 shall provide to parcel owners regarding a proposal for the
  8  1 revival of use restrictions. The proposal may be voted upon at
  8  2 a meeting which shall be held no less than 14 days and no more
  8  3 than 60 days after notice was provided to the parcel owners.
  8  4 The proposal may also be voted on by written ballot. If the
  8  5 vote is by written ballot, the notice must specify when ballots
  8  6 are due, which must be no earlier than 14 days and no later than
  8  7 60 days after the written ballots were delivered.
  8  8    Upon proper notice, if the owners of a majority of the
  8  9 affected parcels in the common interest community approve the
  8 10 revival of lapsed use restrictions, the lapsed use restrictions
  8 11 are revived as to all parcels in the common interest community.
  8 12    The revived use restrictions become effective upon
  8 13 recordation. The revived use restrictions are not given
  8 14 retroactive applicability. Revived use restrictions may not be
  8 15 enforced against a parcel if a parcel owner made a good=faith
  8 16 investment that would be impaired by such enforcement and such
  8 17 investment was made while the use restriction was unenforceable
  8 18 under Code section 614.24 and before the use restriction was
