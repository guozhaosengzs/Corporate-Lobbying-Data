  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to hunter education license requirements,
  8 11 provides for a hunting license with an apprentice hunter
  8 12 designation, and includes penalties.
  8 13    The bill renames the "hunter safety and ethics education
  8 14 course" described in Code section 483A.27, whose completion is
  8 15 required to purchase a hunting license in this state, as the
  8 16 "hunter education course".  Coordinating amendments are made to
  8 17 numerous other Code provisions that reference the course.
  8 18    The bill also amends Code section 483A.27 to provide that
  8 19 the curriculum for the entire course shall be based on the
  8 20 standards adopted by the international hunter education
  8 21 association ==== United States of America.  The cost for a
  8 22 duplicate certificate of completion of the course is changed to
  8 23 the amount of the writing fee and administrative fee instead of
  8 24 specifying that the cost is $3.
  8 25    New Code section 483A.27A provides that, notwithstanding the
  8 26 requirements of Code section 483A.27, a person aged 16 years or
  8 27 older may purchase a hunting license with an apprentice hunter
  8 28 designation without first completing the hunter education
  8 29 course if the person meets the requirements of the new Code
  8 30 section.
  8 31    New Code section 483A.27A provides that if an apprentice
  8 32 hunter is a minor, the person must be accompanied and aided
  8 33 while hunting by a mentor who is the person's parent or
  8 34 guardian or another competent adult consented to by the
  8 35 parent or guardian.  If the apprentice hunter is not a minor,
  9  1 the person must be accompanied and aided while hunting by a
  9  2 competent adult mentor.
  9  3    The mentor and the apprentice hunter must have valid hunting
  9  4 licenses that include the wildlife habitat fee and that are
  9  5 valid for the same seasons to hunt game.  A resident mentor
  9  6 and a resident apprentice hunter must also have deer or wild
  9  7 turkey hunting licenses that are valid for the same seasons or
  9  8 zones if hunting for deer or wild turkey. A transportation tag
  9  9 issued to an apprentice hunter cannot be used to tag a deer or
  9 10 wild turkey taken by another person. A nonresident apprentice
  9 11 hunter is not entitled to purchase a deer hunting license or
  9 12 a wild turkey hunting license or to participate in a hunt for
  9 13 deer or wild turkey.
  9 14    While hunting, an apprentice hunter must be under the direct
  9 15 supervision of the mentor.  "Direct supervision" means that
  9 16 the mentor must maintain constant direction and control of
