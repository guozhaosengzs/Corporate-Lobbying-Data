GENERAL.
This
bill
provides
for
an
environmental

5


agreement
and
related

The
purpose
of
the

credit
is
to
assist
crop
farmers
in
reducing
soil
erosion
and
7


sediment
loss,
managing
nutrients,
and
reducing
contaminant
8


loads
contributing
to
surface
waters,
and
improving
surface

The
bill
provides
that
such
agreements
are
10


to
be
administered
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
land
11


stewardship
(DALS)
in
cooperation
with
the
soil

The

is
13

14


ENVIRONMENTAL
PRACTICES
AGREEMENTS.
The
bill
allows
a
crop
15


farmer
to
enter
into
an
environmental
practices
agreement
16


(agreement)
with
DALS.
The
agreement
requires
the
crop
farmer
17


to
establish
and
maintain
an
environmental
practice
(practice)
18


on
the
crop
farmer’s
cropland
for
the
period
specified
in
the
19


agreement
but
not
more
than
20
years.
The
bill
provides
for
20


the
inspection
of
the
cropland
where
the
practice
is
to
be
21


installed
or
has
been
installed.
The
commissioners
of
a
soil
22


and
water
conservation
district
where
a
practice
is
proposed
23


to
be
or
has
been
installed
is
deemed
to
be
the
agent
of
the
24


department.
The
agreement
does
not
create
a
lien
on
the
land
25


or
bind
a
successor
in
interest
unless
the
successor
agrees.
26


The
bill
provides
that
DALS
must
notify
DOR
that
the
crop
27


farmer
has
executed
an
agreement
and
installed
a
practice.

_____


award
granted
by
a
public
or
private
entity
(e.g.,
cost-share
1


moneys).
The
credit
is
allowed
against
individual
and
2


corporate
income
taxes.

TAX
CREDIT
CERTIFICATES.
Upon
receipt
of
DALS’
notice,
DOR
4


is
required
to
issue
a
tax
credit
certificate
(certificate)
5


to
the
crop
farmer.
However,
not
more
than
$3
million
in
6


tax
credit
certificates
may
be
issued
in
any
state
fiscal
7


year.
A
certificate
is
transferable
to
another
person
who
may
8


claim
or
transfer
the
credit.
DOR
must
rescind
a
certificate
9


if
an
agreement
is
terminated
and
it
may
suspend
or
rescind
10


a
certificate
if
its
holder
is
not
in
compliance
with
the
11


bill’s
requirements.
If
a
credit
is
rescinded
due
to
the
12


termination
of
an
agreement,
the
crop
farmer
is
liable
for
13


repaying
the
unclaimed
value
of
credit
on
a
prorated
basis
plus
14


interest.
The
interest
rate
to
be
applied
depends
on
whether
15


the
termination
is
considered
nonhostile
or
hostile.
The
16


termination
is
nonhostile
if
the
cropland
is
to
be
transferred
17


to
another
person
who
converts
it
to
a
use
incompatible
with
18


crop
production.
Under
these
circumstances,
the
interest
rate
19


is
that
published
by
DOR
in
the
Iowa
Administrative
Bulletin.
20


The
termination
is
hostile
under
any
other
circumstances
and
21


under
those
circumstances
the
interest
rate
is
the
published
22


rate
multiplied
by
10.
A
transferee
is
also
liable
for
23


repayment,
unless
the
credit
was
obtained
by
the
transferee
for
24


value,
in
good
faith,
and
without
actual
or
constructive
notice
25


of
the
agreement’s
breach.
26


EFFECTIVE
AND
APPLICABILITY
DATES.
The
bill
takes
effect
27


upon
enactment
for
environmental
practices
first
established
28


on
or
after
that
date
and
applies
retroactively
to
tax
years
29


beginning
on
and
after
January
1,
2015.
