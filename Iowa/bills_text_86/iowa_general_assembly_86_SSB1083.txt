by

under
the
streamlined
sales
and
use
tax

25


(agreement).

use

in
all

28


states
according
to
the

Under

the

sales
and
use
taxes
in

A
taxability
4


matrix
is
a
comprehensive
list
of
items
subject
to
and
exempt
5


from
the
sales
and
use
tax
that
is
required
to
be
maintained
by
6


each
member
state
of
the
agreement.
The
bill
provides
that
if
7


Iowa
amends
an
existing
provision
of
its
taxability
matrix,
a
8


seller
or
certified
service
provider
is
relieved
from
liability
9


to
the
state
and
its
local
taxing
jurisdictions
for
having
10


charged
and
collected
the
incorrect
amount
of
sales
or
use
tax
11


according
to
the
prior
version
of
the
taxability
matrix.
The
12


liability
relief
extends
until
the
first
day
of
the
calendar
13


month
that
is
at
least
30
days
after
the
state
submits
to
the
14


governing
board
of
the
agreement
the
notice
of
change
to
the
15


taxability
matrix.
16


The
bill
also
provides
that
sellers
and
certified
service
17


providers
are
relieved
from
liability

the

or
its
local
18


taxing
jurisdictions
for
having
charged
and
collected
the
19


incorrect
amount
of
sales
or
use
tax
after
relying
on
erroneous
20


data
provided
in
the
state’s
