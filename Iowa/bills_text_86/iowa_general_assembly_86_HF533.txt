  2  9 case upon a showing of substantial evidence that the failure
  2 10 to wear a seat belt contributed to the injuries claimed.
  2 11 Current law provides that the maximum amount which damages may
  2 12 be reduced for failure to wear a motor vehicle safety belt
  2 13 or safety harness is 5 percent of the damages awarded. This

  2 22 child restraint system, safety belts, or safety harnesses
  2 23 for persons under the age of 18, as required by Code section
