the
child’s
11


individualized
education
program.
12


If
there
is
no
agreement
between
districts,
or
if
the
13


distance
requirements
are
not
met,
the
bill
provides
that
the
14


tuition
limitations
of
Code
section
282.1
shall
not
apply,
15


and
a
student
attending
school
in
the

shall
not
16


be
treated
as
a
pupil
of
the
district
of

in
Iowa
17


for
purposes
of
tuition
payments
to
the
receiving
district
18


or
for
purposes
of
the
school
aid
formula.
The
bill
further
19


establishes
that
an
agreement
reached
under
Code
section
282.8
20


does
not
qualify
as
a
whole
grade
sharing
agreement
and
the
21


open
enrollment
provisions
do
not
apply
to
such
an
agreement.
22


WHOLE
GRADE
SHARING
AGREEMENTS.

in
which
all
or
a
24


substantial
portion
of
the
pupils
in
any
grade
in
two
or
25


more
school
districts
share
an
educational
program
for
all
26


or
a
substantial

of
a

Currently,
the

part
of
29


the
new

the
disposition
of
funding
30


provided
under
Code
chapter
284,
the

2018.

The

10


OPEN
ENROLLMENT
PAYMENTS.
In
addition
to
other
statutory
11


requirements
for
open

the

the
board
of
directors
of
the
district
of
residence
13


must

the
receiving

for
the
previous
fiscal

15


or
the
teacher
leadership
supplement
foundation

for
the
16


previous
fiscal
year
if
both
the
district
of
residence
and
the
17


receiving
district
are
receiving
such
supplements.
Such
a
18


limitation
currently
exists
in
Code
section
284.13,
subsection

paragraph
“e”,
regarding
the
teacher
leadership
supplement
20


foundation
aid.
Currently,
the
district
of
residence
must
pay
21


to
the
receiving
district
the
teacher
leadership
supplement
22


state
cost
per
pupil
for
the
previous
fiscal
year
whether
23


or
not
both
districts
are
receiving
the
teacher
leadership
24


supplement
state
cost
per
pupil.
25


Currently,
a
district
of
residence
must
make
quarterly
26

Under
the
bill,
the
27

Currently,
the

QUALITY
PROGRAM.
Currently,
2


in
developing
administrative
rules
for

the
3


state

8


might
reasonably
be
affected
by
the
proposed
rule.
9


TERMINOLOGY

Code
sections
282.8
and

REPEALS.
The
bill
repeals
the
following:
15


1.
TEACHER
EXCHANGE
PROGRAM.
The
teacher
exchange
program
16


was
enacted
in
1991,
contingent
on
an
appropriation
of
moneys
17


by
the
general
assembly,
to
permit
school
districts
to
exchange
18


licensed
instructional
personnel
with
other
districts
in
order
19


to
promote
the
exchange
and
enhancement
of
instructional
20


methods
and
materials
and
encourage
the
educational
development
21


of
Iowa’s
teachers.
The
bill
eliminates
the
provisions
22


relating
to
the
teacher
exchange
program,
including
provisions
23


directing
the
state
board
to
adopt
rules
to
administer
the
24


program,
directing
the
director
of
the
department
of
education
25


to
administer
the
program,
establishing
the
program,
and
26


providing
for
participation
in
the
program
by
school
districts
27


and
teachers.
28


2.
PILOT
PROJECTS
TO
IMPROVE
INSTRUCTIONAL
PROGRAMS.
When
29


first
enacted
in
1987,
the
provision
was
part
of
a
program
30


to
offer
incentives
to
school
districts
that
established
31


pilot
projects
to
utilize
a
modified
block
schedule
for
32


offering
classes
in
the
districts
and
sharing
the
certificated
33


instructional
personnel.
Implementation
by
the
department
34


of
education
is
dependent
on
