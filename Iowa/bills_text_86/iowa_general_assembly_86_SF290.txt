 23 19 renewed on or after July 1, 2016.
 23 20                           EXPLANATION
 23 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 23    This bill regulates agreements between manufacturers or
 23 24 distributors, and dealers relating to the sale of recreational
 23 25 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 26 provisions.
 23 27    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 28 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 29 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 30 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 31 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 32 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 33 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 34 vehicle" includes a "motor home" which is a motorized vehicle,
 23 35 and a "travel trailer" such as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding
 24  1 camping trailer, truck camper, or a park model recreational
 24  2 vehicle, which is nonmotorized and towable.
 24  3    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 24  4 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 24  5 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 24  6 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 24  7 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 24  8 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with or
 24  9 without cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24 10 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24 11 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24 12 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24 13 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24 14 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24 15 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24 16    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24 17 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 18 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 19 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 20 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 21 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 22 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 23 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 24    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 25 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 26 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 27 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 28 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 29 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 30 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 31 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 32 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 33 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 34 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 35 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 25  1 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 25  2 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 25  3    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 25  4 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 25  5 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 25  6 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 25  7 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 25  8 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  9 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25 10 other concerning warranties.
 25 11    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25 12 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25 13 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25 14 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25 15 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25 16    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25 17 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 18 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 19 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 20 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 21    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 22 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 23 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 24 recover actual damages and the prevailing party in the action
 25 25 is entitled to attorney fees and costs.  However, prior to
 25 26 bringing suit, the party alleging the violation is required
 25 27 to serve a demand for mediation upon the alleged offending
 25 28 party.  The parties must mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation demand
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.

 23 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 23    This bill regulates agreements between manufacturers or
 23 24 distributors, and dealers relating to the sale of recreational
 23 25 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 26 provisions.
 23 27    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 28 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 29 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 30 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 31 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 32 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 33 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 34 vehicle" includes a "motor home" which is a motorized vehicle,
 23 35 and a "travel trailer" such as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding
 24  1 camping trailer, truck camper, or a park model recreational
 24  2 vehicle, which is nonmotorized and towable.
 24  3    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 24  4 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 24  5 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 24  6 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 24  7 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 24  8 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with or
 24  9 without cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24 10 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24 11 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24 12 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24 13 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24 14 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24 15 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24 16    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24 17 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 18 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 19 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 20 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 21 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 22 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 23 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 24    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 25 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 26 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 27 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 28 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 29 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 30 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 31 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 32 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 33 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 34 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 35 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 25  1 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 25  2 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 25  3    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 25  4 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 25  5 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 25  6 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 25  7 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 25  8 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  9 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25 10 other concerning warranties.
 25 11    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25 12 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25 13 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25 14 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25 15 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25 16    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25 17 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 18 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 19 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 20 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 21    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 22 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 23 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 24 recover actual damages and the prevailing party in the action
 25 25 is entitled to attorney fees and costs.  However, prior to
 25 26 bringing suit, the party alleging the violation is required
 25 27 to serve a demand for mediation upon the alleged offending
 25 28 party.  The parties must mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation demand
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.

 23 34 vehicle" includes a "motor home" which is a motorized vehicle,
 23 35 and a "travel trailer" such as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding
 24  1 camping trailer, truck camper, or a park model recreational
 24  2 vehicle, which is nonmotorized and towable.
 24  3    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 24  4 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 24  5 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 24  6 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 24  7 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 24  8 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with or
 24  9 without cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24 10 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24 11 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24 12 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24 13 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24 14 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24 15 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24 16    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24 17 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 18 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 19 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 20 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 21 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 22 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 23 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 24    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 25 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 26 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 27 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 28 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 29 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 30 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 31 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 32 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 33 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 34 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 35 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 25  1 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 25  2 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 25  3    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 25  4 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 25  5 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 25  6 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 25  7 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 25  8 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  9 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25 10 other concerning warranties.
 25 11    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25 12 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25 13 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25 14 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25 15 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25 16    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25 17 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 18 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 19 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 20 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 21    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 22 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 23 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 24 recover actual damages and the prevailing party in the action
 25 25 is entitled to attorney fees and costs.  However, prior to
 25 26 bringing suit, the party alleging the violation is required
 25 27 to serve a demand for mediation upon the alleged offending
 25 28 party.  The parties must mutually select and share the cost of
 25 29 retaining an independent mediator to attempt to resolve the
 25 30 dispute or alleged violation.  Service of the mediation demand
 25 31 tolls the time for filing any other proceeding or action and
 25 32 the district court is required to suspend any proceeding or
 25 33 action until the mediation meeting occurs.  In addition to any
 25 34 other remedy, either party may apply to the district court for
 25 35 a temporary or permanent injunction.

 23 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 23 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 23 23    This bill regulates agreements between manufacturers or
 23 24 distributors, and dealers relating to the sale of recreational
 23 25 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 26 provisions.
 23 27    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 28 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 29 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 30 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 31 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 32 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 33 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational
 23 34 vehicle" includes a "motor home" which is a motorized vehicle,
 23 35 and a "travel trailer" such as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding
 24  1 camping trailer, truck camper, or a park model recreational
 24  2 vehicle, which is nonmotorized and towable.
 24  3    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 24  4 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 24  5 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 24  6 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 24  7 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer
 24  8 may terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the agreement with or
 24  9 without cause and the bill specifies notification requirements,
 24 10 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24 11 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of
 24 12 remaining inventory of recreational vehicles and outstanding
 24 13 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24 14 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24 15 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24 16    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24 17 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 18 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 19 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 20 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 21 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 22 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 23 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 24    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 25 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 26 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 27 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 28 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 29 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 30 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 31 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 32 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 33 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 34 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 35 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 25  1 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 25  2 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 25  3    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 25  4 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 25  5 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 25  6 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 25  7 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 25  8 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  9 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25 10 other concerning warranties.
 25 11    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25 12 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25 13 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful

 23 25 vehicles and includes coordinating amendments and applicability
 23 26 provisions.
 23 27    DIVISION I.  New Code chapter 322E regulates manufacturer
 23 28 and dealer agreements fixing the rights and responsibilities of
 23 29 each party pertaining to the sale of new recreational vehicles
 23 30 in the state.  A "recreational vehicle" is a vehicle that is
 23 31 either self=propelled or towed by a consumer=owned tow vehicle
 23 32 and is primarily designed to provide temporary living quarters
 23 33 for recreational, camping, or travel use.  A "recreational

 23 35 and a "travel trailer" such as a fifth=wheel trailer, folding
 24  1 camping trailer, truck camper, or a park model recreational
 24  2 vehicle, which is nonmotorized and towable.
 24  3    A manufacturer or distributor, and a dealer are required
 24  4 to enter into a written manufacturer and dealer agreement
 24  5 before selling new recreational vehicles in the state.  The
 24  6 agreement must designate the dealer's exclusive area of sales
 24  7 responsibility.  A manufacturer or distributor, or a dealer

 24 10 what factors may be considered in determining whether good
 24 11 cause exists, and requirements concerning repurchase or sale of

 24 13 financial obligations between the parties to the agreement.
 24 14 The party that terminates, cancels, or fails to renew the
 24 15 agreement for good cause has the burden of showing cause.
 24 16    The bill requires that a dealer that desires to make a change
 24 17 in ownership of the dealership give notice to the manufacturer
 24 18 or distributor of the proposed change.  The manufacturer or
 24 19 distributor is not allowed to object to the proposal unless the
 24 20 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 21 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 22 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 23 complies with the bill's requirements.
 24 24    A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from failing to
 24 25 provide a dealer with the opportunity to designate a family
 24 26 member as a successor to the dealership in the event of the
 24 27 dealer's death, incapacity, or retirement so long as the
 24 28 dealer gives written notice of the designation before it takes
 24 29 effect.  The manufacturer or distributor cannot object to the
 24 30 designation unless the dealer is in breach of the manufacturer
 24 31 and dealer agreement or in violation of the provisions of new
 24 32 Code chapter 322E or the objection is due to other specified
 24 33 factors.  A manufacturer or distributor is prohibited from
 24 34 refusing to honor the succession of the designated family
 24 35 member unless the manufacturer or distributor has provided the
 25  1 dealer with written notice of an objection to the dealer's
 25  2 designation after receiving notice of the designation.
 25  3    In regards to warranty obligations on new recreational
 25  4 vehicles, the bill requires the warrantor, that person
 25  5 providing a written warranty on the vehicles, to specify the
 25  6 dealer's obligations for preparation, delivery, and warranty
 25  7 services on the warrantor's products and how the dealer will
 25  8 be compensated for provision of those services.  The bill
 25  9 specifies the warrantor's and dealer's obligations to each
 25 10 other concerning warranties.
 25 11    The bill provides that both the warrantor and the dealer have
 25 12 duties to indemnify and hold each other harmless to the extent
 25 13 that losses or damages are caused by the negligence or willful
 25 14 misconduct of the other.  These duties continue even after a
 25 15 new recreational vehicle is titled.
 25 16    The bill specifies the rights and obligations of a dealer and
 25 17 a manufacturer or distributor when a new recreational vehicle
 25 18 is damaged in transit.  The bill specifies a time frame for a
 25 19 dealer to inspect a delivered vehicle and to either reject or
 25 20 request to repair the damaged vehicle.
 25 21    A dealer, manufacturer, distributor, or warrantor injured
 25 22 by another party's violation of the provisions of new Code
 25 23 chapter 322E may bring a civil action in district court to
 25 24 recover actual damages and the prevailing party in the action
 25 25 is entitled to attorney fees and costs.  However, prior to
 25 26 bringing suit, the party alleging the violation is required
 25 27 to serve a demand for mediation upon the alleged offending
 25 28 party.  The parties must mutually select and share the cost of

 24 20 objection is due to factors specified in the bill concerning
 24 21 the proposed transferee.  The manufacturer must make a written
 24 22 objection and has the burden of proving that the objection
 24 23 complies with the bill's requirements.
