NEW
SECTION

249A.9
Medicaid
transformation
and
1


oversight
commission
——
findings,
goals,
and
intent.
2


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
that
state
Medicaid
program
3


initiatives
have
consistently
advanced
the
goals
of
a
health
4


care
delivery
system
that
improves
population
health,
enhances
5


the
experiences
and
outcomes
of
patients,
reduces
the
costs
of
6


care,
and
integrates
and
coordinates
services
and
supports
to
7


address
social
determinants
of
health.
Existing
initiatives,
8


including
the
healthiest
state
initiative,
the
balancing
9


incentive
program,
the
Iowa
health
and
wellness
plan
created
10


pursuant
to
chapter
249N,
and
the
state
innovation
models
11


initiative,
all
reflect
these
consistent
goals.
Each
of
12


these
programs
and
initiatives
has
been
formulated
to
realign
13


the
health
care
delivery
system
to
provide
whole-person,
14


patient-centered
care
while
moving
toward
a
value
and
15


risk-based
model
of
reimbursement.
16


2.
Legislative
involvement
and
oversight
is
essential
to
17


ensure
stakeholder
input,
consumer
protection,
and
quality
18


assurance
in
the
transformation
of
the
Medicaid
program.
A
19


transition
to
a
managed
care
system,
especially
one
that
20


affects
vulnerable
populations
so
diverse
in
medical
and
21


functional
needs
and
that
involves
such
a
wide
spectrum
of
22


providers
and
state
agencies,
requires
intentional
planning
23


and
attention.
The
state
must
also
provide
for
appropriate
24


and
adequate
infrastructure,
resources,
and
funding
to
ensure
25


accountability
to
and
compliance
with
state
policy,
rules,
and
26


contract
requirements.
27


3.
Given
the
challenges
presented,
a
Medicaid
28


transformation
and
oversight
commission
is
created
to
provide
29


a
formal
venue
for
guidance
and
oversight
of
and
stakeholder
30


engagement
in,
the
design,
development,
and
implementation
of
31


Medicaid
program
transformation.
