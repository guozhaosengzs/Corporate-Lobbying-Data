information
for
registered
owners
of

vehicles,
and
any

other

provided
to
the

agent
by
the
DOT.

At
least
twice
a
month,
the

agent
shall
update
6


the
database
and
compare
current
motor
vehicle
registrations
7


with
updated
insurance

The
files
in
the
database
8


shall
be
archived
semiannually
and

The
bill
requires
the
DOT
to

11


If
database
records
show
that
a
registered
motor
vehicle
12


is
not
covered
under
an
owner’s
policy
of
liability
insurance
13


for
three
months,
the
designated
agent
shall
send
a
notice
14


to
the
owner
requiring
the
owner
to
respond
within
15
days
15


by
providing
proof
of
financial
liability
coverage
or
proof
16


that
the
owner
is
exempt
from
the
requirement
to
maintain
17


financial
liability
coverage.
If
the
owner
fails
to
respond,
18


a
second
notice
will
be
sent.
If
the
owner
does
not
respond
19


to
the
second
notice,
the
owner’s
motor
vehicle
registration
20


will
be
revoked
by
the

and
the

will
be
required
to
21


surrender
the
registration
plates
and
registration
receipt
for
22


the
vehicle
to
the
county

In
order

obtain
a
23


new

for
the
vehicle,
the
owner
must
comply
with
24


financial
responsibility
requirements
and
pay
an
administrative
25


fee
of

The
fees
are
to
be
used
by
the
DOT
exclusively
to
26


offset
the
costs
of
administering
the
program.
27


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
motor
vehicle
is
covered
by
a
28


form
of
financial
liability
coverage
other
than
an
insurance
29


policy,
that
fact
shall
be
noted
in
the
database.
30


The
bill
prohibits
a
person
from
providing
false

fraudulent

the
DOT
or

DOT’s
designated
32


agent
in

may
be
assessed
a
civil
penalty
of
$250
per
day.
10


However,
the
DOT
may

penalty
upon
a
showing
that
the
11


failure
was
inadvertent,
accidental,
or
the
result
of
excusable
12


neglect.
An
insurer
that
discloses
records
to
the
DOT’s
13


designated
agent
in
a
reasonable,
good-faith
effort
to
comply
14


with
the
bill
is
not

interest

The
designated

may
be
authorized

or

information
29


is
guilty
of
