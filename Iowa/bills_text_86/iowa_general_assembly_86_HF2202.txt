  1 31 project established in SF 494 (2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132),
  1 32 which appropriated $1.23 million to the college for purposes
  1 33 of developing a database to measure the impact of existing
  1 34 agricultural practices and nutrient management decisions on the
  1 35 transport of nutrients from nonpoint sources within watersheds.
