  3 31 according to subsections 2 through 5.  Any civil penalty
  3 32 recovered shall be deposited in the general fund of the state.
  3 33    2.  The commissioner may propose that an employer be assessed
  3 34 a civil penalty by serving the employer with notice of such
  3 35 proposal in the same manner as an original notice is served
  4  1 under the rules of civil procedure.  Upon service of such
  4  2 notice, the proposed assessment shall be treated as a contested
  4  3 case under chapter 17A.  However, an employer must request a
  4  4 hearing within thirty days of being served.

  4  6 to subsection 2 or if the commissioner determines, after an
  4  7 appropriate hearing, that an employer is in violation of this

  4  9 commissioner shall assess a civil penalty which is consistent
  4 10 with the provisions of subsection 1 and which is rendered with
  4 11 due consideration for the penalty amount in terms of the size
  4 12 of the employer's business, the gravity of the violation,
  4 13 the good faith of the employer, and the history of previous
  4 14 violations.
  4 15    4.  An employer may seek judicial review of any assessment
  4 16 rendered under subsection 3 by instituting proceedings for
  4 17 judicial review pursuant to chapter 17A.  However, such
  4 18 proceedings must be instituted in the district court of the
  4 19 county in which the violation or one of the violations occurred
  4 20 and within thirty days of the day on which the employer was
  4 21 notified that an assessment has been rendered.  Also, an
  4 22 employer may be required, at the discretion of the district
  4 23 court and upon instituting such proceedings, to deposit the
  4 24 amount assessed with the clerk of the district court.  Any
  4 25 moneys so deposited shall either be returned to the employer
  4 26 or be forwarded to the commissioner for deposit in the general
  4 27 fund of the state, depending on the outcome of the judicial
  4 28 review, including any appeal to the supreme court.
  4 29    5.  After the time for seeking judicial review has expired
  4 30 or after all judicial review has been exhausted and the
  4 31 commissioner's assessment has been upheld, the commissioner
  4 32 shall request the attorney general to recover the assessed
  4 33 penalties in a civil action.

  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill creates a new Code chapter 91F that requires an
  5 16 employer to provide an employee with appropriate meal periods
  5 17 and appropriate rest periods.
  5 18    The bill states that an appropriate meal period shall be not
  5 19 less than 30 minutes during an employee's work period of at
  5 20 least seven hours.  The meal period is to be taken between the
  5 21 second and fifth hours of the work or, if the employee works
  5 22 more than seven hours, between the third and sixth hours.
  5 23    The bill states that an appropriate rest period shall be a
  5 24 paid period of not less than 10 minutes during every four=hour
  5 25 work period.  The rest period is taken in the middle of the work
  5 26 period.  The rest period is in addition to the meal period and
  5 27 cannot be added to the meal period or deducted from the work
  5 28 period to reduce the overall length of the total work period.
  5 29    The bill defines an "employee" as a natural person who is
  5 30 employed in this state for wages by an employer.  An "employer"
  5 31 is defined as a person, as defined in Code section 4.1, who
  5 32 employs a natural person for wages.
  5 33    The bill provides that an employer is not required to pay for
  5 34 a meal period if an employee is free from work duties during
  5 35 the employee's entire meal period.

  6  2 requirements.  The first exemption is if the meal and rest
  6  3 period requirements are modified by the terms of a collective
  6  4 bargaining agreement.  However, the exemption is valid only
  6  5 if the collective bargaining agreement entered into by the
  6  6 employees prescribes specific terms concerning meal periods and
  6  7 rest periods.
  6  8    The second exemption states that meal and rest period
  6  9 requirements apply to hourly paid and salary=paid employees.
  6 10 However, management or employees involved in certain
  6 11 agricultural jobs are not required to have breaks or meal
  6 12 breaks.
  6 13    The third exemption is when an employer can show that the
  6 14 ordinary nature and circumstance of the work prevented the
  6 15 employer from establishing and maintaining a regular scheduled
  6 16 meal period.
  6 17    The bill provides civil penalties for violating the new
  6 18 Code chapter.  An employer who violates the provisions shall
  6 19 be subject to a penalty of up to $100 for each violation.  The
  6 20 labor commissioner may recover the penalties under Code chapter
  6 21 17A contested case procedures.  Any penalties recovered shall
  6 22 be deposited in the general fund of the state.
  6 23    The commissioner may propose that an employer be assessed a
  6 24 penalty by serving the employer with notice of a penalty in the
  6 25 same manner as an original notice is served under the rules of
  6 26 civil procedure.
  6 27    The bill provides the labor commissioner with the authority
  6 28 to provide further exemptions from new Code chapter 91F when
  6 29 reasonable.  Also, the labor commissioner or the commissioner's
  6 30 designee may inspect employment records relating to rest
  6 31 periods for employees and interview an employer or employee or
  6 32 an agent of the employer or employee, during working hours or
