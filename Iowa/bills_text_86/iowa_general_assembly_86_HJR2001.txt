  2 11    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 12 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to terms of service
  2 13 for persons elected to the offices of representative or senator
  2 14 in the general assembly.  The proposed amendment provides that
  2 15 any person elected as a representative shall be eligible to
  2 16 serve eight consecutive terms in that position but shall not

  2 18 provides that any person elected as a senator shall be eligible
  2 19 to serve four consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 20 be eligible to serve a fifth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 21 therefore limits the offices of representatives and senators
  2 22 to 16 consecutive years of service in a particular chamber
  2 23 of the general assembly. The amendment provides that a
  2 24 resignation from office would not serve to break the counting
  2 25 of consecutive terms for the person resigning but would not be
  2 26 counted as a term of office for the person filling the vacancy.

  2 13 for persons elected to the offices of representative or senator
  2 14 in the general assembly.  The proposed amendment provides that
  2 15 any person elected as a representative shall be eligible to
  2 16 serve eight consecutive terms in that position but shall not

  2 18 provides that any person elected as a senator shall be eligible
  2 19 to serve four consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 20 be eligible to serve a fifth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 21 therefore limits the offices of representatives and senators
  2 22 to 16 consecutive years of service in a particular chamber
  2 23 of the general assembly. The amendment provides that a
  2 24 resignation from office would not serve to break the counting
  2 25 of consecutive terms for the person resigning but would not be
  2 26 counted as a term of office for the person filling the vacancy.

  2 28 with terms of office beginning on or after January 1, 2035.
  2 29    The resolution, if adopted, would be referred to the next

  2 11    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 12 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to terms of service
  2 13 for persons elected to the offices of representative or senator
  2 14 in the general assembly.  The proposed amendment provides that
  2 15 any person elected as a representative shall be eligible to
  2 16 serve eight consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 17 be eligible to serve a ninth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 18 provides that any person elected as a senator shall be eligible
  2 19 to serve four consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 20 be eligible to serve a fifth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 21 therefore limits the offices of representatives and senators
  2 22 to 16 consecutive years of service in a particular chamber
  2 23 of the general assembly. The amendment provides that a
  2 24 resignation from office would not serve to break the counting
  2 25 of consecutive terms for the person resigning but would not be
  2 26 counted as a term of office for the person filling the vacancy.
  2 27 The limitation on consecutive terms of service shall commence
  2 28 with terms of office beginning on or after January 1, 2035.
  2 29    The resolution, if adopted, would be referred to the next
  2 30 general assembly for adoption before being submitted to the

  2 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 11    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 12 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to terms of service
  2 13 for persons elected to the offices of representative or senator
  2 14 in the general assembly.  The proposed amendment provides that
  2 15 any person elected as a representative shall be eligible to
  2 16 serve eight consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 17 be eligible to serve a ninth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 18 provides that any person elected as a senator shall be eligible
  2 19 to serve four consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 20 be eligible to serve a fifth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 21 therefore limits the offices of representatives and senators
  2 22 to 16 consecutive years of service in a particular chamber
  2 23 of the general assembly. The amendment provides that a
  2 24 resignation from office would not serve to break the counting
  2 25 of consecutive terms for the person resigning but would not be
  2 26 counted as a term of office for the person filling the vacancy.
  2 27 The limitation on consecutive terms of service shall commence
  2 28 with terms of office beginning on or after January 1, 2035.

  2 11    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 12 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to terms of service
  2 13 for persons elected to the offices of representative or senator
  2 14 in the general assembly.  The proposed amendment provides that
  2 15 any person elected as a representative shall be eligible to
  2 16 serve eight consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 17 be eligible to serve a ninth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 18 provides that any person elected as a senator shall be eligible
  2 19 to serve four consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 20 be eligible to serve a fifth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 21 therefore limits the offices of representatives and senators
  2 22 to 16 consecutive years of service in a particular chamber
  2 23 of the general assembly. The amendment provides that a
  2 24 resignation from office would not serve to break the counting
  2 25 of consecutive terms for the person resigning but would not be
  2 26 counted as a term of office for the person filling the vacancy.
  2 27 The limitation on consecutive terms of service shall commence
  2 28 with terms of office beginning on or after January 1, 2035.
  2 29    The resolution, if adopted, would be referred to the next

  2 11    This joint resolution proposes an amendment to the
  2 12 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to terms of service
  2 13 for persons elected to the offices of representative or senator
  2 14 in the general assembly.  The proposed amendment provides that
  2 15 any person elected as a representative shall be eligible to
  2 16 serve eight consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 17 be eligible to serve a ninth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 18 provides that any person elected as a senator shall be eligible
  2 19 to serve four consecutive terms in that position but shall not
  2 20 be eligible to serve a fifth consecutive term.  The amendment
  2 21 therefore limits the offices of representatives and senators
  2 22 to 16 consecutive years of service in a particular chamber
  2 23 of the general assembly. The amendment provides that a
  2 24 resignation from office would not serve to break the counting
  2 25 of consecutive terms for the person resigning but would not be
  2 26 counted as a term of office for the person filling the vacancy.
