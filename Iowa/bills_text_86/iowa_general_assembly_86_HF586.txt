  5 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 34    GENERAL.  This bill applies to animal feeding operations in
  5 35 which animals are confined and fed and maintained for 45 days
  6  1 or more in any 12=month period, and specifically confinement
  6  2 feeding operations constructed under a roof that store liquid
  6  3 manure (Code chapter 459). The chapter is administered and
  6  4 enforced by the department of natural resources under the
  6  5 direction of the environmental protection commission.
  6  6    MANURE MANAGEMENT PLANS.  The bill provides that if the
  6  7 department prepares a public record stating that a person has
  6  8 failed to comply with the requirements for filing a manure
  6  9 management plan, it must indicate whether the noncompliance was
  6 10 due to an obvious mistake or oversight.
  6 11    CERTIFIED MANURE APPLICATORS.  The bill allows the
  6 12 department to require that a vehicle or tank used by a
  6 13 certified commercial manure service or certified commercial
  6 14 manure service representative transporting manure on a
  6 15 public road display a certification number as assigned by the
  6 16 department, but cannot require other information identifying
  6 17 the certified commercial manure service or the certified
  6 18 commercial manure service representative.
  6 19    BIOSECURITY.  The bill requires that when the owner or
  6 20 manager of an animal feeding operation alleges that a person
  6 21 who is a departmental official, an agent of the department, or
  6 22 a county employee fails to comply with biosecurity requirements
  6 23 during an inspection of an animal feeding operation or a
  6 24 construction site where an animal feeding operation exists,
  6 25 that person must leave the premises or site at the request
  6 26 of the owner or manager.  However, this requirement does not
  6 27 apply to a department official who inspects an existing animal
  6 28 feeding operation pursuant to a search warrant issued by a
  6 29 district court which specifies the biosecurity requirements to
  6 30 be followed.
  6 31    DOCUMENT RETENTION.  The bill provides that a county board
  6 32 of supervisors may elect not to accept certain documents
  6 33 related to the regulation of animal feeding operations, and
  6 34 specifically confinement feeding operations.  Specifically, the
  6 35 bill allows a county board of supervisors to adopt a resolution
  7  1 to forego receiving an application or related materials
  7  2 for a permit to construct a confinement feeding operation
  7  3 structure or a manure management plan governing the storage and
  7  4 application of manure from a confinement feeding operation.
  7  5 The board may request the department to transmit the document
  7  6 to the county if it is not available on the department's
  7  7 internet site.
