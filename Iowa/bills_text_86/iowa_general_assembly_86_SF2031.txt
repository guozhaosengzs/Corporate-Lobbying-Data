  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    This bill establishes a community solar garden program.
  3 34 The bill defines a "community solar garden facility" to mean
  3 35 an electric generating facility with a nameplate generating
  4  1 capacity of one megawatt or less that generates electricity by
  4  2 means of a ground=mounted or roof=mounted solar photovoltaic
  4  3 device whereby subscribers receive a billing credit for the
  4  4 electricity generated in proportion to the size of their
  4  5 subscription. The bill defines "subscriber" to mean a
  4  6 retail customer of an electric utility who owns one or more
  4  7 subscriptions of a community solar garden interconnected with
  4  8 that utility.  The bill defines a "subscription" to mean a
  4  9 proportional contractual interest in a community solar garden
  4 10 facility, together with a proportional interest in any state or
  4 11 federal tax credits for which a community solar garden facility
  4 12 may be eligible.
  4 13    The bill provides that an electric public utility subject to
  4 14 rate regulation shall be required to establish and maintain one
  4 15 or more community solar garden facilities, consisting of not
  4 16 less than five subscribers to each facility, of which no single
  4 17 subscriber has more than a 40 percent interest in the facility.
  4 18 The bill states that a community solar garden facility may be
  4 19 owned by the utility or by any other entity or organization,
  4 20 including a subscriber organization, that contracts to sell the
  4 21 output from the community solar garden facility to the utility.
  4 22    The bill requires a community solar garden facility to
  4 23 be located within the utility's service area, and requires
  4 24 subscribers to be retail customers of the utility located in
  4 25 the same county or a county contiguous to where the facility
  4 26 is located.  Each subscription is required to be sized to
  4 27 represent at least 200 watts of the community solar garden
  4 28 facility's generating capacity and to supply, when combined
  4 29 with other distributed generation resources serving the
  4 30 premises, no more than 120 percent of the average annual
  4 31 consumption of electricity by each subscriber at the premises
  4 32 to which the subscription is attached.  The bill provides that
  4 33 rates applicable to facilities shall either be the same rates
  4 34 applicable to alternate energy production facilities pursuant
  4 35 to Code section 476.43, or an alternative rate if established
  5  1 by the board.  The bill provides that a subscriber's portion of
  5  2 the electricity purchased shall be provided as a credit on the
  5  3 subscriber's billing, that a utility shall not be required to
  5  4 purchase an amount of electricity from one or more community
  5  5 solar garden facilities in an amount exceeding 4 percent of its
  5  6 average annual electricity sales, and that the community solar
  5  7 garden requirements are in addition to, and not in lieu of,
  5  8 alternate energy purchase and ownership requirements specified
  5  9 in Code section 476.44.
  5 10    The bill requires a utility subject to the bill's provisions
  5 11 to submit a community solar garden program plan to the
  5 12 Iowa utilities board by September 30, 2016, incorporating

  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    This bill establishes a community solar garden program.
  3 34 The bill defines a "community solar garden facility" to mean
  3 35 an electric generating facility with a nameplate generating
  4  1 capacity of one megawatt or less that generates electricity by
  4  2 means of a ground=mounted or roof=mounted solar photovoltaic
  4  3 device whereby subscribers receive a billing credit for the
  4  4 electricity generated in proportion to the size of their
  4  5 subscription. The bill defines "subscriber" to mean a
  4  6 retail customer of an electric utility who owns one or more
  4  7 subscriptions of a community solar garden interconnected with
  4  8 that utility.  The bill defines a "subscription" to mean a
  4  9 proportional contractual interest in a community solar garden
  4 10 facility, together with a proportional interest in any state or
  4 11 federal tax credits for which a community solar garden facility
  4 12 may be eligible.
  4 13    The bill provides that an electric public utility subject to
  4 14 rate regulation shall be required to establish and maintain one
  4 15 or more community solar garden facilities, consisting of not
  4 16 less than five subscribers to each facility, of which no single
  4 17 subscriber has more than a 40 percent interest in the facility.
  4 18 The bill states that a community solar garden facility may be
  4 19 owned by the utility or by any other entity or organization,
  4 20 including a subscriber organization, that contracts to sell the
  4 21 output from the community solar garden facility to the utility.
  4 22    The bill requires a community solar garden facility to
  4 23 be located within the utility's service area, and requires
  4 24 subscribers to be retail customers of the utility located in
  4 25 the same county or a county contiguous to where the facility
  4 26 is located.  Each subscription is required to be sized to
  4 27 represent at least 200 watts of the community solar garden
  4 28 facility's generating capacity and to supply, when combined
  4 29 with other distributed generation resources serving the
  4 30 premises, no more than 120 percent of the average annual
  4 31 consumption of electricity by each subscriber at the premises
  4 32 to which the subscription is attached.  The bill provides that
  4 33 rates applicable to facilities shall either be the same rates
  4 34 applicable to alternate energy production facilities pursuant
  4 35 to Code section 476.43, or an alternative rate if established
  5  1 by the board.  The bill provides that a subscriber's portion of
  5  2 the electricity purchased shall be provided as a credit on the
  5  3 subscriber's billing, that a utility shall not be required to
  5  4 purchase an amount of electricity from one or more community
  5  5 solar garden facilities in an amount exceeding 4 percent of its
  5  6 average annual electricity sales, and that the community solar
  5  7 garden requirements are in addition to, and not in lieu of,
  5  8 alternate energy purchase and ownership requirements specified
  5  9 in Code section 476.44.
  5 10    The bill requires a utility subject to the bill's provisions
  5 11 to submit a community solar garden program plan to the
  5 12 Iowa utilities board by September 30, 2016, incorporating
  5 13 specified  components.  The bill provides that the plan shall
  5 14 be implemented within 90 days following the date of approval,
  5 15 and that within 180 days following the date of approval, the
  5 16 utility shall begin crediting subscriber accounts for each
  5 17 community solar garden facility within its service area.  The
  5 18 utility is required to file an updated plan on an annual
  5 19 basis summarizing the operation and status of its community
  5 20 solar garden program and detailing the amount of electricity
  5 21 generated by facilities and credited to subscribers.

  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    This bill establishes a community solar garden program.
  3 34 The bill defines a "community solar garden facility" to mean
  3 35 an electric generating facility with a nameplate generating
  4  1 capacity of one megawatt or less that generates electricity by
  4  2 means of a ground=mounted or roof=mounted solar photovoltaic
  4  3 device whereby subscribers receive a billing credit for the
  4  4 electricity generated in proportion to the size of their
  4  5 subscription. The bill defines "subscriber" to mean a
  4  6 retail customer of an electric utility who owns one or more
  4  7 subscriptions of a community solar garden interconnected with
  4  8 that utility.  The bill defines a "subscription" to mean a
  4  9 proportional contractual interest in a community solar garden
  4 10 facility, together with a proportional interest in any state or
  4 11 federal tax credits for which a community solar garden facility
  4 12 may be eligible.
  4 13    The bill provides that an electric public utility subject to
  4 14 rate regulation shall be required to establish and maintain one
  4 15 or more community solar garden facilities, consisting of not
  4 16 less than five subscribers to each facility, of which no single
  4 17 subscriber has more than a 40 percent interest in the facility.
  4 18 The bill states that a community solar garden facility may be
  4 19 owned by the utility or by any other entity or organization,
  4 20 including a subscriber organization, that contracts to sell the
  4 21 output from the community solar garden facility to the utility.
  4 22    The bill requires a community solar garden facility to
  4 23 be located within the utility's service area, and requires
  4 24 subscribers to be retail customers of the utility located in
  4 25 the same county or a county contiguous to where the facility
  4 26 is located.  Each subscription is required to be sized to
  4 27 represent at least 200 watts of the community solar garden
  4 28 facility's generating capacity and to supply, when combined
  4 29 with other distributed generation resources serving the
  4 30 premises, no more than 120 percent of the average annual
  4 31 consumption of electricity by each subscriber at the premises
  4 32 to which the subscription is attached.  The bill provides that
  4 33 rates applicable to facilities shall either be the same rates
  4 34 applicable to alternate energy production facilities pursuant
  4 35 to Code section 476.43, or an alternative rate if established
  5  1 by the board.  The bill provides that a subscriber's portion of
  5  2 the electricity purchased shall be provided as a credit on the
  5  3 subscriber's billing, that a utility shall not be required to
  5  4 purchase an amount of electricity from one or more community
  5  5 solar garden facilities in an amount exceeding 4 percent of its
  5  6 average annual electricity sales, and that the community solar
  5  7 garden requirements are in addition to, and not in lieu of,
  5  8 alternate energy purchase and ownership requirements specified
  5  9 in Code section 476.44.
  5 10    The bill requires a utility subject to the bill's provisions
  5 11 to submit a community solar garden program plan to the

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    This bill establishes a community solar garden program.
  3 34 The bill defines a "community solar garden facility" to mean
  3 35 an electric generating facility with a nameplate generating
  4  1 capacity of one megawatt or less that generates electricity by
  4  2 means of a ground=mounted or roof=mounted solar photovoltaic
  4  3 device whereby subscribers receive a billing credit for the
  4  4 electricity generated in proportion to the size of their
  4  5 subscription. The bill defines "subscriber" to mean a
  4  6 retail customer of an electric utility who owns one or more
  4  7 subscriptions of a community solar garden interconnected with
  4  8 that utility.  The bill defines a "subscription" to mean a
  4  9 proportional contractual interest in a community solar garden
  4 10 facility, together with a proportional interest in any state or
  4 11 federal tax credits for which a community solar garden facility
  4 12 may be eligible.
  4 13    The bill provides that an electric public utility subject to
  4 14 rate regulation shall be required to establish and maintain one
  4 15 or more community solar garden facilities, consisting of not
  4 16 less than five subscribers to each facility, of which no single
  4 17 subscriber has more than a 40 percent interest in the facility.
  4 18 The bill states that a community solar garden facility may be
  4 19 owned by the utility or by any other entity or organization,
  4 20 including a subscriber organization, that contracts to sell the
  4 21 output from the community solar garden facility to the utility.
  4 22    The bill requires a community solar garden facility to
  4 23 be located within the utility's service area, and requires
  4 24 subscribers to be retail customers of the utility located in
  4 25 the same county or a county contiguous to where the facility
  4 26 is located.  Each subscription is required to be sized to
  4 27 represent at least 200 watts of the community solar garden
  4 28 facility's generating capacity and to supply, when combined
  4 29 with other distributed generation resources serving the
  4 30 premises, no more than 120 percent of the average annual
  4 31 consumption of electricity by each subscriber at the premises
  4 32 to which the subscription is attached.  The bill provides that
  4 33 rates applicable to facilities shall either be the same rates
  4 34 applicable to alternate energy production facilities pursuant
  4 35 to Code section 476.43, or an alternative rate if established
  5  1 by the board.  The bill provides that a subscriber's portion of
  5  2 the electricity purchased shall be provided as a credit on the
  5  3 subscriber's billing, that a utility shall not be required to
  5  4 purchase an amount of electricity from one or more community
  5  5 solar garden facilities in an amount exceeding 4 percent of its
  5  6 average annual electricity sales, and that the community solar
  5  7 garden requirements are in addition to, and not in lieu of,
  5  8 alternate energy purchase and ownership requirements specified
  5  9 in Code section 476.44.
  5 10    The bill requires a utility subject to the bill's provisions
  5 11 to submit a community solar garden program plan to the
  5 12 Iowa utilities board by September 30, 2016, incorporating
  5 13 specified  components.  The bill provides that the plan shall
  5 14 be implemented within 90 days following the date of approval,
  5 15 and that within 180 days following the date of approval, the
  5 16 utility shall begin crediting subscriber accounts for each
  5 17 community solar garden facility within its service area.  The
  5 18 utility is required to file an updated plan on an annual
  5 19 basis summarizing the operation and status of its community
  5 20 solar garden program and detailing the amount of electricity
  5 21 generated by facilities and credited to subscribers.

  3 33    This bill establishes a community solar garden program.
  3 34 The bill defines a "community solar garden facility" to mean
  3 35 an electric generating facility with a nameplate generating
  4  1 capacity of one megawatt or less that generates electricity by
  4  2 means of a ground=mounted or roof=mounted solar photovoltaic
  4  3 device whereby subscribers receive a billing credit for the
  4  4 electricity generated in proportion to the size of their
  4  5 subscription. The bill defines "subscriber" to mean a
  4  6 retail customer of an electric utility who owns one or more
  4  7 subscriptions of a community solar garden interconnected with
  4  8 that utility.  The bill defines a "subscription" to mean a
  4  9 proportional contractual interest in a community solar garden
  4 10 facility, together with a proportional interest in any state or
  4 11 federal tax credits for which a community solar garden facility
  4 12 may be eligible.
  4 13    The bill provides that an electric public utility subject to
  4 14 rate regulation shall be required to establish and maintain one
  4 15 or more community solar garden facilities, consisting of not
  4 16 less than five subscribers to each facility, of which no single
  4 17 subscriber has more than a 40 percent interest in the facility.

  4 19 owned by the utility or by any other entity or organization,
  4 20 including a subscriber organization, that contracts to sell the
  4 21 output from the community solar garden facility to the utility.
  4 22    The bill requires a community solar garden facility to
  4 23 be located within the utility's service area, and requires
  4 24 subscribers to be retail customers of the utility located in
  4 25 the same county or a county contiguous to where the facility
  4 26 is located.  Each subscription is required to be sized to
  4 27 represent at least 200 watts of the community solar garden
  4 28 facility's generating capacity and to supply, when combined
  4 29 with other distributed generation resources serving the
  4 30 premises, no more than 120 percent of the average annual
  4 31 consumption of electricity by each subscriber at the premises
  4 32 to which the subscription is attached.  The bill provides that
  4 33 rates applicable to facilities shall either be the same rates
  4 34 applicable to alternate energy production facilities pursuant
  4 35 to Code section 476.43, or an alternative rate if established
  5  1 by the board.  The bill provides that a subscriber's portion of
  5  2 the electricity purchased shall be provided as a credit on the

  4 16 less than five subscribers to each facility, of which no single
  4 17 subscriber has more than a 40 percent interest in the facility.
  4 18 The bill states that a community solar garden facility may be
  4 19 owned by the utility or by any other entity or organization,
  4 20 including a subscriber organization, that contracts to sell the
  4 21 output from the community solar garden facility to the utility.
  4 22    The bill requires a community solar garden facility to
  4 23 be located within the utility's service area, and requires
  4 24 subscribers to be retail customers of the utility located in
  4 25 the same county or a county contiguous to where the facility
  4 26 is located.  Each subscription is required to be sized to
  4 27 represent at least 200 watts of the community solar garden
  4 28 facility's generating capacity and to supply, when combined
  4 29 with other distributed generation resources serving the
  4 30 premises, no more than 120 percent of the average annual
  4 31 consumption of electricity by each subscriber at the premises
  4 32 to which the subscription is attached.  The bill provides that
  4 33 rates applicable to facilities shall either be the same rates

  3 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 33    This bill establishes a community solar garden program.
  3 34 The bill defines a "community solar garden facility" to mean
  3 35 an electric generating facility with a nameplate generating
  4  1 capacity of one megawatt or less that generates electricity by
  4  2 means of a ground=mounted or roof=mounted solar photovoltaic
  4  3 device whereby subscribers receive a billing credit for the
  4  4 electricity generated in proportion to the size of their
  4  5 subscription. The bill defines "subscriber" to mean a
  4  6 retail customer of an electric utility who owns one or more
  4  7 subscriptions of a community solar garden interconnected with
  4  8 that utility.  The bill defines a "subscription" to mean a
  4  9 proportional contractual interest in a community solar garden
  4 10 facility, together with a proportional interest in any state or
  4 11 federal tax credits for which a community solar garden facility
  4 12 may be eligible.
  4 13    The bill provides that an electric public utility subject to
  4 14 rate regulation shall be required to establish and maintain one
  4 15 or more community solar garden facilities, consisting of not
  4 16 less than five subscribers to each facility, of which no single
  4 17 subscriber has more than a 40 percent interest in the facility.
  4 18 The bill states that a community solar garden facility may be
  4 19 owned by the utility or by any other entity or organization,
  4 20 including a subscriber organization, that contracts to sell the
  4 21 output from the community solar garden facility to the utility.
  4 22    The bill requires a community solar garden facility to
  4 23 be located within the utility's service area, and requires
  4 24 subscribers to be retail customers of the utility located in
  4 25 the same county or a county contiguous to where the facility
  4 26 is located.  Each subscription is required to be sized to
  4 27 represent at least 200 watts of the community solar garden
  4 28 facility's generating capacity and to supply, when combined
  4 29 with other distributed generation resources serving the
  4 30 premises, no more than 120 percent of the average annual
  4 31 consumption of electricity by each subscriber at the premises
  4 32 to which the subscription is attached.  The bill provides that
  4 33 rates applicable to facilities shall either be the same rates
  4 34 applicable to alternate energy production facilities pursuant
  4 35 to Code section 476.43, or an alternative rate if established
  5  1 by the board.  The bill provides that a subscriber's portion of
  5  2 the electricity purchased shall be provided as a credit on the
  5  3 subscriber's billing, that a utility shall not be required to
  5  4 purchase an amount of electricity from one or more community
  5  5 solar garden facilities in an amount exceeding 4 percent of its
  5  6 average annual electricity sales, and that the community solar
  5  7 garden requirements are in addition to, and not in lieu of,
  5  8 alternate energy purchase and ownership requirements specified
  5  9 in Code section 476.44.
  5 10    The bill requires a utility subject to the bill's provisions
