FINDINGS
AND
INTENT.
1


1.
The
general
assembly
finds
all
of
the
following:
2


a.
The
majority
of
aging
Iowans
and
individuals
with
3


disabilities
want
to
live
as
independently
as
possible
in
their
4


own
communities
for
as
long
as
possible.
5


b.
The
increasing
number
of
aging
Iowans
and
individuals
6


with
disabilities
requires
a
greater
supply
of
health
and
7


long-term
care
workers.
8


c.
The
safety
and
well-being
of
Iowans
is
dependent
upon
a
9


stable
health
and
long-term
care
workforce
to
serve
their
needs
10


when
and
where
such
needs
arise.
11


d.
The
direct
care
workforce
is
America’s
fastest
growing
12


profession,
with
the
need
estimated
by
the
state
direct
care
13


workforce
initiative
in
Iowa
to
be
20,000
new
direct
care
14


positions
by
the
year
2020.
However,
the
number
of
individuals
15


who
typically
fill
these
positions,
typically
women
between
the
16


ages
of
18
and
44,
is
dwindling,
while
those
working
in
the
17


field
experience
an
average
annual
turnover
rate
of
between
40
18


and
60
percent.
19


e.
High
staff
turnover
cost
taxpayers
and
the
state
millions
20


of
dollars,
annually,
but
more
consistent
and
reliable
data
on
21


supply,
demand,
turnover,
turnover
costs,
staffing
levels,
and
22


various
data
correlation
and
other
analyses
of
this
critical
23


workforce
is
needed.
24


f.
Extensive
work
has
already
been
done
to
study
the
issues
25


impacting
the
direct
care
workforce
and
other
providers
of
26


health
and
long-term
care
with
significant
public
and
private
27


sector
investment,
including:
28


(1)
The
direct
care
worker
compensation
advisory
committee
29


which
submitted
recommendations
for
consideration
by
the
30


general
assembly
in
the
2009
legislative
session
regarding
31


wages
and
other
compensation
paid
to
direct
care
workers
in
32


nursing
facilities.
The
recommendations
included
strategies
33


to
improve
wages
and
benefits
paid
to
direct
care
workers
34


employed
in
Iowa’s
nursing
facilities
that,
in

would

(2)
The
various

on
the

the
Alzheimer’s

and
the
personal

(PHCAST)
7


project
undertaken
through
a
federal

accumulation
of
relevant
data
by

these
studies

concerns.

(2)
Iowa
Code
section
135.11,
subsection
27,
directs
4


the
department
of
public
health
to
establish
and
administer,
5


if
sufficient
funds
are

health
and
the
directives

department
relating
to
the
health
and
long-term

workforce,
17


it
is
the
intent
of
the
general
assembly
that
an
Iowa
health
18


workforce
center
be
established
within
the
department
of
public
19


health
to
act
as
the
state’s
coordination
point
to
address
20


health
workforce
concerns.
21


a.

by
the
department,
will
32


result
in
a
return
on
investment
through
improved
utilization
33


of
tax

which
has
the
potential
to
result
