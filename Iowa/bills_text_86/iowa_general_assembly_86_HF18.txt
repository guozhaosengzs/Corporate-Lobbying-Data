  2  5    Sec. 4.    2  5    Sec. 4.    2  6    1.  When a collective bargaining agreement between a public
  2  7 employer and a certified employee organization, which provides
  2  8 that a fair share fee shall be charged to nonmembers of the
  2  9 employee organization, is reached by ratification of the
  2 10 agreement or by issuance of an arbitration award under section
  2 11 20.22, the public employer shall, within ten days of the date
  2 12 the agreement is reached, provide the employee organization
  2 13 with a list of the names and addresses of all employees in the
  2 14 bargaining unit represented by the employee organization.  If a
  2 15 collective bargaining agreement providing for fair share fees
  2 16 has a term of more than one year, the list shall be provided by
  2 17 the public employer annually, not later than thirty days prior
  2 18 to the commencement of the next full year of the agreement's
  2 19 term.
  2 20    2.  a.  Following receipt by the employee organization of
  2 21 a list of employees pursuant to subsection 1, the employee
  2 22 organization shall provide the public employer with the name
  2 23 of each nonmember of the employee organization and the amount
  2 24 of the fair share fee.  In addition, the employee organization
  2 25 shall provide the labor commissioner with the amount of the
  2 26 fair share fee and any supporting documentation utilized in
  2 27 determining the amount of the fair share fee.  Commencing on
  2 28 the effective date of the collective bargaining agreement which
  2 29 provides for a fair share fee or the public employer's receipt
  2 30 of the names and amounts from the employee organization,
  2 31 whichever occurs later, the public employer shall deduct once
  2 32 each month from the wages or salaries of each nonmember the
  2 33 amount of the fair share fee specified for that nonmember by
  2 34 the employee organization and transmit the amounts deducted
  2 35 to the employee organization within fourteen days of the
  3  1 deduction.  If a collective bargaining agreement includes a
  3  2 retroactive effective date, the public employer shall make
  3  3 deductions for fair share fees prospectively only.
  3  4    b.  For purposes of determining the fair share fee, the
  3  5 amount of the fair share fee shall not exceed the regular
  3  6 membership dues paid by members of the employee organization
  3  7 and shall not include any share of the costs incurred by the
  3  8 employee organization for fraternal, ideological, political, or
  3  9 other activities not germane to collective bargaining, contract
  3 10 administration, the adjustment of grievances, or the pursuit
  3 11 of other matters affecting wages, hours, and other conditions
  3 12 of employment.  Costs that shall be excluded from the fair
  3 13 share fee include but are not limited to costs for social
  3 14 events; lobbying on issues or for purposes other than the
  3 15 negotiation, ratification, or implementation of a collective
  3 16 bargaining agreement; voter registration training; efforts to
  3 17 increase voting; political campaign techniques; supporting or
  3 18 contributing to charitable organizations; and supporting or
  3 19 contributing to religious or other ideological causes.
  3 20    3.  As a precondition to the collection of a fair share fee,
  3 21 the employee organization shall establish and maintain a full
  3 22 and fair procedure that conforms with the requirements of the
  3 23 Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the
  3 24 State of Iowa and does all of the following:
  3 25    a.  Provides nonmembers of the employee organization with
  3 26 an annual notice which informs them of the amount of the
  3 27 fair share fee to be charged, provides them with sufficient
  3 28 information to gauge the propriety of that amount, and informs
  3 29 them of the procedure by which a nonmember may challenge that
  3 30 amount.
  3 31    b.  Permits challenges by nonmembers to the amount of the
  3 32 fair share fee.
  3 33    c.  Provides for the consolidation of all timely challenges
  3 34 and for an impartial hearing, before an arbitrator appointed by
  3 35 the American arbitration association pursuant to its rules for
  4  1 impartial determination of union fees, conducted in accordance
  4  2 with those rules and paid for by the employee organization.
  4  3    d.  Provides that the burden of proof relating to the
  4  4 propriety of the amount of the fair share fee is on the
  4  5 employee organization.
  4  6    e.  Provides that all fair share fees reasonably in dispute
  4  7 while a challenge is pending shall be held by the employee
  4  8 organization in an interest=bearing escrow account until a
  4  9 final decision is issued by the arbitrator, at which time such
  4 10 funds shall be disbursed in accordance with the arbitrator's
  4 11 decision.
  4 12    4.  The employee organization shall notify the public
  4 13 employer of any arbitrator's award issued pursuant to the
  4 14 challenge procedure specified in subsection 3 which reduced the
  4 15 amount of a fair share fee and the public employer shall adjust
  4 16 its deduction from the wages or salaries of the challenging
  4 17 nonmembers accordingly.
  4 18    5.  This section shall be enforced through an action in a
  4 19 court of competent jurisdiction.
  4 20    Sec. 5.  Section 731.3, Code 2015, is amended to read as
  4 21 follows:

  2 10 agreement or by issuance of an arbitration award under section
  2 11 20.22, the public employer shall, within ten days of the date
  2 12 the agreement is reached, provide the employee organization
  2 13 with a list of the names and addresses of all employees in the
  2 14 bargaining unit represented by the employee organization.  If a
  2 15 collective bargaining agreement providing for fair share fees
  2 16 has a term of more than one year, the list shall be provided by
  2 17 the public employer annually, not later than thirty days prior
  2 18 to the commencement of the next full year of the agreement's
  2 19 term.
  2 20    2.  a.  Following receipt by the employee organization of
  2 21 a list of employees pursuant to subsection 1, the employee
  2 22 organization shall provide the public employer with the name
  2 23 of each nonmember of the employee organization and the amount
  2 24 of the fair share fee.  In addition, the employee organization
  2 25 shall provide the labor commissioner with the amount of the
  2 26 fair share fee and any supporting documentation utilized in
  2 27 determining the amount of the fair share fee.  Commencing on
  2 28 the effective date of the collective bargaining agreement which
  2 29 provides for a fair share fee or the public employer's receipt
  2 30 of the names and amounts from the employee organization,
  2 31 whichever occurs later, the public employer shall deduct once
  2 32 each month from the wages or salaries of each nonmember the
  2 33 amount of the fair share fee specified for that nonmember by
  2 34 the employee organization and transmit the amounts deducted
  2 35 to the employee organization within fourteen days of the
  3  1 deduction.  If a collective bargaining agreement includes a
  3  2 retroactive effective date, the public employer shall make
  3  3 deductions for fair share fees prospectively only.
  3  4    b.  For purposes of determining the fair share fee, the
  3  5 amount of the fair share fee shall not exceed the regular
  3  6 membership dues paid by members of the employee organization
  3  7 and shall not include any share of the costs incurred by the
  3  8 employee organization for fraternal, ideological, political, or
  3  9 other activities not germane to collective bargaining, contract
  3 10 administration, the adjustment of grievances, or the pursuit
  3 11 of other matters affecting wages, hours, and other conditions
  3 12 of employment.  Costs that shall be excluded from the fair
  3 13 share fee include but are not limited to costs for social

  5 29                           EXPLANATION
  5 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 32    This bill authorizes the negotiating of fair share fees in
  5 33 collective bargaining agreements.
  5 34    Code chapter 20, concerning collective bargaining for public
  5 35 employees, is amended to authorize fair share fees.
  6  1 Code section 20.9 is amended to provide that the scope of
  6  2 negotiations for purposes of a collective bargaining agreement
  6  3 includes negotiating whether a fair share fee shall be charged
  6  4 to nonmembers of an employee organization.
  6  5    New Code section 20.9A establishes the procedures to follow
  6  6 if a fair share fee is included in a collective bargaining
  6  7 agreement.  The new Code section provides that once an
  6  8 agreement is ratified or an arbitration award is issued that
  6  9 includes a fair share fee, the public employer shall, within
  6 10 10 days, provide the employee organization with a list of
  6 11 employees covered by the agreement.  If the agreement has a
  6 12 term of more than one year, the employer shall provide the list
  6 13 on an annual basis.  Once the employee organization receives
  6 14 the list, the employee organization shall provide the employer
  6 15 with a list of each nonmember of the employee organization and
  6 16 the amount of the fair share fee.  The employee organization
  6 17 shall also inform the labor commissioner of the amount of the
  6 18 fair share fee and how it was determined.  The bill provides
  6 19 that the fee shall not exceed the regular membership dues
  6 20 paid by members and shall not include costs of the employee
  6 21 organization that are not germane to collective bargaining,
  6 22 contract administration, the adjustment of grievances, and
  6 23 the pursuit of other matters affecting wages, hours, and
  6 24 other conditions of employment.  The bill provides that the
  6 25 public employer shall begin deducting the fair share fee
  6 26 from nonmembers upon the later of the effective date of the
  6 27 collective bargaining agreement or the date the public employer
  6 28 receives the list of nonmembers and the amount of the fair
  6 29 share fee.  The bill provides that no retroactive deductions
  6 30 for fair share fees are allowed.
  6 31    The bill also establishes several additional conditions for
  6 32 the collection of a fair share fee from public employees.  The
  6 33 bill provides that nonmembers be given an annual notice of the
  6 34 amount of the fair share fee and their rights as to challenging
  6 35 the amount.  The bill also provides that nonmembers shall be
  7  1 permitted to challenge the amount of the fair share fee at
  7  2 an impartial hearing before an arbitrator appointed by the
  7  3 American arbitration association.  The bill provides that the
  7  4 employee organization has the burden of proof relating to the
  7  5 amount of the fee to be charged.  The bill provides that the
  7  6 employee organization shall notify the public employer of any
  7  7 arbitrator's award and the public employer shall adjust the
  7  8 deduction from wages of the nonmembers who challenged the fair
  7  9 share fee amount.  The bill provides that the requirements of
  7 10 this new Code section shall be enforced in a court of competent
  7 11 jurisdiction.
  7 12    Code chapter 731, concerning labor union membership, is
  7 13 also amended to authorize fair share agreements.  New Code
  7 14 section 731.4A provides that a labor union, certified as the
  7 15 bargaining representative of a private sector employer under
  7 16 federal law, may enter into an agreement with an employer that,
  7 17 as a condition of continued employment, requires employees whom
  7 18 the union is certified to represent to become a member of the
  7 19 labor union or to pay a fair share fee to the extent permitted
  7 20 by the United States Constitution, the Iowa Constitution, and
  7 21 applicable federal law.  The new Code section provides that
  7 22 nothing in this Code section shall be deemed to require an
  7 23 employee to become a member of a labor union and also provides
  7 24 that the requirement to pay a fair share fee shall not apply to
  7 25 an employee whose initial date of employment occurred on a date
  7 26 when a fair share agreement was not in effect.
  7 27    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  6 16 the amount of the fair share fee.  The employee organization
  6 17 shall also inform the labor commissioner of the amount of the

  6 30 for fair share fees are allowed.

  6 35 the amount.  The bill also provides that nonmembers shall be
  7  1 permitted to challenge the amount of the fair share fee at
  7  2 an impartial hearing before an arbitrator appointed by the
  7  3 American arbitration association.  The bill provides that the
  7  4 employee organization has the burden of proof relating to the
  7  5 amount of the fee to be charged.  The bill provides that the
  7  6 employee organization shall notify the public employer of any
  7  7 arbitrator's award and the public employer shall adjust the
  7  8 deduction from wages of the nonmembers who challenged the fair
  7  9 share fee amount.  The bill provides that the requirements of
  7 10 this new Code section shall be enforced in a court of competent
  7 11 jurisdiction.
  7 12    Code chapter 731, concerning labor union membership, is
  7 13 also amended to authorize fair share agreements.  New Code
  7 14 section 731.4A provides that a labor union, certified as the
  7 15 bargaining representative of a private sector employer under
  7 16 federal law, may enter into an agreement with an employer that,

  7 19 labor union or to pay a fair share fee to the extent permitted
  7 20 by the United States Constitution, the Iowa Constitution, and

  5 32    This bill authorizes the negotiating of fair share fees in
  5 33 collective bargaining agreements.
  5 34    Code chapter 20, concerning collective bargaining for public
  5 35 employees, is amended to authorize fair share fees.
  6  1 Code section 20.9 is amended to provide that the scope of
  6  2 negotiations for purposes of a collective bargaining agreement
  6  3 includes negotiating whether a fair share fee shall be charged
  6  4 to nonmembers of an employee organization.
  6  5    New Code section 20.9A establishes the procedures to follow
  6  6 if a fair share fee is included in a collective bargaining
  6  7 agreement.  The new Code section provides that once an
  6  8 agreement is ratified or an arbitration award is issued that
  6  9 includes a fair share fee, the public employer shall, within
  6 10 10 days, provide the employee organization with a list of
  6 11 employees covered by the agreement.  If the agreement has a
  6 12 term of more than one year, the employer shall provide the list
  6 13 on an annual basis.  Once the employee organization receives
  6 14 the list, the employee organization shall provide the employer
  6 15 with a list of each nonmember of the employee organization and
  6 16 the amount of the fair share fee.  The employee organization
  6 17 shall also inform the labor commissioner of the amount of the
  6 18 fair share fee and how it was determined.  The bill provides
  6 19 that the fee shall not exceed the regular membership dues
  6 20 paid by members and shall not include costs of the employee
  6 21 organization that are not germane to collective bargaining,
  6 22 contract administration, the adjustment of grievances, and
  6 23 the pursuit of other matters affecting wages, hours, and
  6 24 other conditions of employment.  The bill provides that the
  6 25 public employer shall begin deducting the fair share fee
  6 26 from nonmembers upon the later of the effective date of the
  6 27 collective bargaining agreement or the date the public employer
  6 28 receives the list of nonmembers and the amount of the fair
  6 29 share fee.  The bill provides that no retroactive deductions
  6 30 for fair share fees are allowed.
  6 31    The bill also establishes several additional conditions for
  6 32 the collection of a fair share fee from public employees.  The
  6 33 bill provides that nonmembers be given an annual notice of the
  6 34 amount of the fair share fee and their rights as to challenging
  6 35 the amount.  The bill also provides that nonmembers shall be
  7  1 permitted to challenge the amount of the fair share fee at
  7  2 an impartial hearing before an arbitrator appointed by the
  7  3 American arbitration association.  The bill provides that the
  7  4 employee organization has the burden of proof relating to the
  7  5 amount of the fee to be charged.  The bill provides that the
  7  6 employee organization shall notify the public employer of any
  7  7 arbitrator's award and the public employer shall adjust the
  7  8 deduction from wages of the nonmembers who challenged the fair
  7  9 share fee amount.  The bill provides that the requirements of
  7 10 this new Code section shall be enforced in a court of competent
  7 11 jurisdiction.
  7 12    Code chapter 731, concerning labor union membership, is
  7 13 also amended to authorize fair share agreements.  New Code
  7 14 section 731.4A provides that a labor union, certified as the
  7 15 bargaining representative of a private sector employer under
  7 16 federal law, may enter into an agreement with an employer that,
  7 17 as a condition of continued employment, requires employees whom
  7 18 the union is certified to represent to become a member of the
  7 19 labor union or to pay a fair share fee to the extent permitted
  7 20 by the United States Constitution, the Iowa Constitution, and
  7 21 applicable federal law.  The new Code section provides that
  7 22 nothing in this Code section shall be deemed to require an
  7 23 employee to become a member of a labor union and also provides
  7 24 that the requirement to pay a fair share fee shall not apply to
  7 25 an employee whose initial date of employment occurred on a date
  7 26 when a fair share agreement was not in effect.

  6  5    New Code section 20.9A establishes the procedures to follow
  6  6 if a fair share fee is included in a collective bargaining
  6  7 agreement.  The new Code section provides that once an
  6  8 agreement is ratified or an arbitration award is issued that
  6  9 includes a fair share fee, the public employer shall, within
  6 10 10 days, provide the employee organization with a list of
  6 11 employees covered by the agreement.  If the agreement has a
  6 12 term of more than one year, the employer shall provide the list
  6 13 on an annual basis.  Once the employee organization receives
  6 14 the list, the employee organization shall provide the employer
  6 15 with a list of each nonmember of the employee organization and
  6 16 the amount of the fair share fee.  The employee organization
  6 17 shall also inform the labor commissioner of the amount of the
  6 18 fair share fee and how it was determined.  The bill provides
  6 19 that the fee shall not exceed the regular membership dues
  6 20 paid by members and shall not include costs of the employee
  6 21 organization that are not germane to collective bargaining,
  6 22 contract administration, the adjustment of grievances, and
  6 23 the pursuit of other matters affecting wages, hours, and
  6 24 other conditions of employment.  The bill provides that the
  6 25 public employer shall begin deducting the fair share fee
  6 26 from nonmembers upon the later of the effective date of the
  6 27 collective bargaining agreement or the date the public employer
  6 28 receives the list of nonmembers and the amount of the fair
  6 29 share fee.  The bill provides that no retroactive deductions
  6 30 for fair share fees are allowed.
  6 31    The bill also establishes several additional conditions for
  6 32 the collection of a fair share fee from public employees.  The
  6 33 bill provides that nonmembers be given an annual notice of the
  6 34 amount of the fair share fee and their rights as to challenging
  6 35 the amount.  The bill also provides that nonmembers shall be
  7  1 permitted to challenge the amount of the fair share fee at
  7  2 an impartial hearing before an arbitrator appointed by the
  7  3 American arbitration association.  The bill provides that the
  7  4 employee organization has the burden of proof relating to the
  7  5 amount of the fee to be charged.  The bill provides that the
  7  6 employee organization shall notify the public employer of any
  7  7 arbitrator's award and the public employer shall adjust the
  7  8 deduction from wages of the nonmembers who challenged the fair

  5 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 32    This bill authorizes the negotiating of fair share fees in
  5 33 collective bargaining agreements.
  5 34    Code chapter 20, concerning collective bargaining for public
  5 35 employees, is amended to authorize fair share fees.
  6  1 Code section 20.9 is amended to provide that the scope of
  6  2 negotiations for purposes of a collective bargaining agreement
  6  3 includes negotiating whether a fair share fee shall be charged
  6  4 to nonmembers of an employee organization.
  6  5    New Code section 20.9A establishes the procedures to follow
  6  6 if a fair share fee is included in a collective bargaining
  6  7 agreement.  The new Code section provides that once an
  6  8 agreement is ratified or an arbitration award is issued that
  6  9 includes a fair share fee, the public employer shall, within
  6 10 10 days, provide the employee organization with a list of
  6 11 employees covered by the agreement.  If the agreement has a
  6 12 term of more than one year, the employer shall provide the list
  6 13 on an annual basis.  Once the employee organization receives
  6 14 the list, the employee organization shall provide the employer
  6 15 with a list of each nonmember of the employee organization and
  6 16 the amount of the fair share fee.  The employee organization
  6 17 shall also inform the labor commissioner of the amount of the
  6 18 fair share fee and how it was determined.  The bill provides
  6 19 that the fee shall not exceed the regular membership dues
  6 20 paid by members and shall not include costs of the employee
  6 21 organization that are not germane to collective bargaining,
  6 22 contract administration, the adjustment of grievances, and
  6 23 the pursuit of other matters affecting wages, hours, and
  6 24 other conditions of employment.  The bill provides that the
  6 25 public employer shall begin deducting the fair share fee
  6 26 from nonmembers upon the later of the effective date of the
  6 27 collective bargaining agreement or the date the public employer
  6 28 receives the list of nonmembers and the amount of the fair
  6 29 share fee.  The bill provides that no retroactive deductions
  6 30 for fair share fees are allowed.
  6 31    The bill also establishes several additional conditions for
  6 32 the collection of a fair share fee from public employees.  The
  6 33 bill provides that nonmembers be given an annual notice of the
  6 34 amount of the fair share fee and their rights as to challenging
  6 35 the amount.  The bill also provides that nonmembers shall be
  7  1 permitted to challenge the amount of the fair share fee at
  7  2 an impartial hearing before an arbitrator appointed by the
  7  3 American arbitration association.  The bill provides that the
  7  4 employee organization has the burden of proof relating to the
