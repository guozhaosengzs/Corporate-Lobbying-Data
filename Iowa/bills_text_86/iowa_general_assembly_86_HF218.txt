  1  1    Section 1.  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.  The general assembly
  1  2 finds and recognizes all of the following:
  1  3    1.  Access to health care facilities and health care
  1  4 professionals is critically important to the citizens of Iowa.
  1  5    2.  Telehealth uses electronic technology to overcome a
  1  6 geographic distance between patients and health care providers
  1  7 for the purpose of intervention, clinical management, or
  1  8 assessing, monitoring, or educating patients.
  1  9    3.  The provision of telehealth results in demonstrated
  1 10 cost=effectiveness, improvements in disease management,
  1 11 and improved  patient outcomes and studies by the American
  1 12 telemedicine association and others have demonstrated
  1 13 significant reductions in hospitalizations and otherwise
  1 14 necessary medical care as a result of telehealth intervention.
  1 15    4.  Geography, weather, availability of specialists,
  1 16 transportation, and other factors can create barriers to
  1 17 accessing appropriate health care, including behavioral health
  1 18 care, and one way to provide, ensure, or enhance access to
  1 19 care given these barriers is through the appropriate use of
  1 20 technology to allow health care consumers access to qualified
  1 21 health care professionals.
  1 22    5.  Additionally, the utilization of telehealth will
  1 23 further the maintenance and improvement of the physical
  1 24 and economic health of patients in medically underserved
  1 25 communities by retaining the source of health care in local
  1 26 areas, strengthening the health infrastructure, and preserving
  1 27 health=care=related jobs.
  1 28    6.  A need exists in this state to embrace efforts that
  1 29 will encourage health insurers and health care professionals
  1 30 to support the use of telehealth and that will also encourage
  1 31 all state  agencies to evaluate and amend their policies and
  1 32 rules to remove any regulatory barriers prohibiting the use of
  1 33 telehealth.
  1 34    7.  Recognition exists that the full potential of delivering
  1 35 health care services through telehealth cannot be realized
  2  1 without the assurance of payment and the resolution of existing
  2  2 legal and policy barriers to such payment.
  2  3    8.  The purpose of the Iowa telehealth Act is to provide a
  2  4 framework for health care professionals to utilize in providing
  2  5 telehealth to Iowans in a manner that provides efficient and
  2  6 effective access to quality health care.

  4 33 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  4 34 surgical coverage benefits shall not deny coverage on the basis
  4 35 that the services are provided as telehealth if the services
  5  1 would be covered if provided and shall not require in=person
  5  2 contact between a health care professional and a patient as a
  5  3 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  5  4 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  5  5 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable

  5 24 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.

  5 29 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 30 when delivered in person.
  5 31    5.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  5 32 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  5 33 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  5 34 is not appropriate.
  5 35    6.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  6  1 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  6  2 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  6  3 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2016:

  6 19 by the commissioner, disability income insurance coverage,
  6 20 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance,
  6 21 workers' compensation or similar insurance, or automobile
  6 22 medical payment insurance.
  6 23    8.  The commissioner of insurance shall adopt rules pursuant
  6 24 to chapter 17A as necessary to administer this section.
  6 25    9.  For the purposes of this section, "health care
  6 26 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section
  6 27 147B.2, as enacted in this Act.
  6 28    Sec. 6.  MEDICAID PROGRAM ==== REIMBURSEMENT FOR
  6 29 TELEHEALTH.  The department of human services shall adopt
  6 30 rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
  6 31 Medicaid program.  The rules shall provide that in=person
  6 32 contact between a health care professional and a patient
  6 33 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  1 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  2 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  3 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  4 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes
  7  5 of reimbursement.  As used in this section, "health care
  7  6 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section
  7  7 147B.2, as enacted in this Act.
  7  8    Sec. 7.  STUDY ON USE OF TELEHEALTH.  The department of
  7  9 public health, in collaboration with the department of human
  7 10 services and the insurance division of the department of
  7 11 commerce,  shall convene and conduct a study regarding options
  7 12 for implementing telehealth and telehealth coverage and
  7 13 reimbursement.  The department of public health shall submit
  7 14 a final report of its findings and recommendations to the
  7 15 governor and the general assembly by December 15, 2015.
  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and
 11  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2015.

  6 29 TELEHEALTH.  The department of human services shall adopt
  6 30 rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the

  6 33 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  1 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  2 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  3 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  4 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes
  7  5 of reimbursement.  As used in this section, "health care
  7  6 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final

  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in

 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing

  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in

  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in

 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing

  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  1 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  2 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  3 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  4 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes
  7  5 of reimbursement.  As used in this section, "health care
  7  6 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section
  7  7 147B.2, as enacted in this Act.

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and

  5 14 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or

  5 18 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 19 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of

  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties

  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established

  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  1 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  2 the time the services are provided.  Health care services

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and

  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and
 11  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2015.

  5 14 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 15 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 16 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 17 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 18 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 19 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 20    3.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 21 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  5 22 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to

  5 24 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.

  5 29 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 30 when delivered in person.
  5 31    5.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  5 32 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth

  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  1 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  2 the time the services are provided.  Health care services

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and
 11  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2015.

  5 14 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 15 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  5 16 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  5 17 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  5 18 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  5 19 to all items and services under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 20    3.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  5 21 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  5 22 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  5 23 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  5 24 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 25    4.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a

  5 29 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  5 30 when delivered in person.

  7  9 public health, in collaboration with the department of human
  7 10 services and the insurance division of the department of
  7 11 commerce,  shall convene and conduct a study regarding options
  7 12 for implementing telehealth and telehealth coverage and
  7 13 reimbursement.  The department of public health shall submit
  7 14 a final report of its findings and recommendations to the
  7 15 governor and the general assembly by December 15, 2015.
  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and

  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the

  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided

  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the

 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits

  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a

  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to

  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the

  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties

  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are

  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the

 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final

  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  1 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  2 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  3 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  4 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes
  7  5 of reimbursement.  As used in this section, "health care
  7  6 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and
 11  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2015.

  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in

  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the

  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,

  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not

  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a

  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of

 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing

  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and
 11  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2015.

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a

  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are

  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,

  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and
 11  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2015.

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in

 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing

  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the

  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising

  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties

  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are

  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.

 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the

  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A

  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties

  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a

  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional

  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are

  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional

  6 31 Medicaid program.  The rules shall provide that in=person
  6 32 contact between a health care professional and a patient
  6 33 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  1 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  2 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  3 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  4 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes
  7  5 of reimbursement.  As used in this section, "health care
  7  6 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section

  7  8    Sec. 7.  STUDY ON USE OF TELEHEALTH.  The department of
  7  9 public health, in collaboration with the department of human

  7 12 for implementing telehealth and telehealth coverage and
  7 13 reimbursement.  The department of public health shall submit

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and
 11  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2015.

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care

  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional

  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a

  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the

 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to

  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a

  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or

  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care

  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the

  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A

  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided

  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a

  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are

  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services

  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a

  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final

  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.

  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,

  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient

 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums

  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and

 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such

  6 29 TELEHEALTH.  The department of human services shall adopt
  6 30 rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
  6 31 Medicaid program.  The rules shall provide that in=person
  6 32 contact between a health care professional and a patient
  6 33 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
  6 34 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
  6 35 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
  7  1 prevailing in the applicable professional community at
  7  2 the time the services are provided.  Health care services
  7  3 provided through in=person consultations or through telehealth
  7  4 shall be treated as equivalent services for the purposes
  7  5 of reimbursement.  As used in this section, "health care
  7  6 professional" and "telehealth" mean as defined in section
  7  7 147B.2, as enacted in this Act.
  7  8    Sec. 7.  STUDY ON USE OF TELEHEALTH.  The department of
  7  9 public health, in collaboration with the department of human
  7 10 services and the insurance division of the department of
  7 11 commerce,  shall convene and conduct a study regarding options
  7 12 for implementing telehealth and telehealth coverage and
  7 13 reimbursement.  The department of public health shall submit
  7 14 a final report of its findings and recommendations to the
  7 15 governor and the general assembly by December 15, 2015.
  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to

  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.

  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a

  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or

  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,

  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from

  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,

 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to

  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or

  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding

 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to

  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the

  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the

 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the

 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the

  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must

  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties

  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the

  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the

 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the

  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not

  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the

 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in

  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa

  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope

  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A

  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements

  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of

  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to

  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the

  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties

  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,

  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided

  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the

 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.

 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the

 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the

 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the

 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are

 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing

  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
 11  6 report of its findings and recommendations to the governor and
 11  7 the general assembly by December 15, 2015.

  7 19    This bill relates to telehealth and creates the Iowa
  7 20 telehealth Act. The bill provides legislative findings
  7 21 and purposes regarding the use of telehealth and provides
  7 22 definitions.
  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards

 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing

  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of

  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided

  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an

 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the

  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a

  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The

  7 23    The bill provides that a health care professional licensed
  7 24 by a professional licensing board under Code chapter 147
  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from

  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable

  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.

  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or

  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.

  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of

 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an

  7 25 (health=related professions), as appropriate to the scope
  7 26 of practice of the profession, may employ the technology of
  7 27 telehealth by applying telehealth within the professional's
  7 28 scope of practice or by employing telehealth technology
  7 29 under the direction and supervision of another health care
  7 30 professional who is using telehealth technology within the
  7 31 supervising professional's scope of practice. A health care
  7 32 professional's employment of telehealth technology under the
  7 33 direction and supervision of another health care professional
  7 34 who is acting within that health care professional's scope of
  7 35 practice shall not be interpreted as practicing the supervising
  8  1 professional's health care profession without a license. A
  8  2 health care professional employing telehealth technology must
  8  3 hold a current valid license and must be trained, educated,
  8  4 and knowledgeable regarding the health care service provided
  8  5 and technology used and is prohibited from performing duties
  8  6 for which the professional does not have sufficient training,
  8  7 education, and knowledge. Failure to have sufficient training,
  8  8 education, and knowledge is grounds for disciplinary action by
  8  9 the respective board.
  8 10    The bill directs the appropriate board that exercises
  8 11 regulatory or rulemaking authority over a profession within
  8 12 whose scope of practice telehealth may be employed or the
  8 13 department, to adopt rules, to administer the requirements
  8 14 relating to the provision of telehealth by such professionals.
  8 15    The bill provides that the standard of care for a
  8 16 professional, whether using telehealth or providing the care
  8 17 in person, is the same.  The type of setting where telehealth
  8 18 is provided for the patient or by the health care professional
  8 19 is not to be limited if the delivery of health care services is
  8 20 appropriately provided through telehealth. The bill is not to
  8 21 be construed to conflict with or supersede the provisions of
  8 22 the health care professionals licensing chapters  relating to
  8 23 the licensure of the respective health care professional or to
  8 24 alter the scope of practice of any health care professional,
  8 25 authorize the delivery of health care services in a setting
  8 26 or manner not otherwise authorized by law, or limit a
  8 27 patient's right to choose in=person contact with a health care
  8 28 professional for the delivery of health care services for which
  8 29 telehealth is available. The bill also provides that if a
  8 30 health care professional provides services pursuant to and in
  8 31 compliance with Code section 135.24 relating to the volunteer
  8 32 health care provider program, via telehealth, the provisions of
  8 33 Code section 135.24 including those relating to immunity from
  8 34 civil liability shall apply to such health care professional.
  8 35    The bill provides that beginning January 1, 2016, a
  9  1 contract, policy, or plan providing for third=party payment or
  9  2 prepayment for health, medical, or surgical coverage benefits
  9  3 shall not deny coverage on the basis that the services are
  9  4 provided via telehealth if the services would be covered if
  9  5 provided in person and shall not require in=person contact
  9  6 between a health care professional and a patient as a
  9  7 prerequisite for payment for services appropriately provided
  9  8 through telehealth in accordance with generally accepted health
  9  9 care practices and standards prevailing in the applicable
  9 10 professional community at the time the services are provided.
  9 11 Health care services provided through in=person consultations
  9 12 or through telehealth shall be treated as equivalent services
  9 13 for the purposes of coverage.
  9 14    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  9 15 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  9 16 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  9 17 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  9 18 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  9 19 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  9 20 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  9 21 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  9 22 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  9 23 applies in the aggregate to all items and services under the
  9 24 contract, policy, or plan.
  9 25    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  9 26 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  9 27 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  9 28 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  9 29 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  9 30 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  9 31 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  9 32 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  9 33 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  9 34 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  9 35 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
 10  1 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
 10  2 telehealth is not appropriate.
 10  3    The Code section applies to individual or group accident and
 10  4 sickness insurance providing coverage on an expense=incurred
 10  5 basis; an individual or group hospital or medical service
 10  6 contract issued pursuant to Code chapter 509, 514, or 514A; an
 10  7 individual or group health maintenance organization contract
 10  8 regulated under Code chapter 514B; an individual or group
 10  9 Medicare supplemental policy, unless coverage pursuant to such
 10 10 policy is preempted by federal law; and a plan established
 10 11 pursuant to Code chapter 509A for public employees. The
 10 12 provision does not apply to accident=only, specified disease,
 10 13 short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement indemnity,
 10 14 credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic hospital,
 10 15 and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined by the
 10 16 commissioner, disability income insurance coverage, coverage
 10 17 issued as a supplement to liability insurance, workers'
 10 18 compensation or similar insurance, or automobile medical
 10 19 payment insurance.
 10 20    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
 10 21 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
 10 22 provision.
 10 23    The bill directs the department of human services to
 10 24 adopt rules to provide for coverage of telehealth under the
 10 25 Medicaid program.  The rules are to provide that in=person
 10 26 contact between a health care professional and a patient
 10 27 is not required as a prerequisite for payment for services
 10 28 appropriately provided through telehealth in accordance
 10 29 with generally accepted health care practices and standards
 10 30 prevailing in the applicable professional community at the
 10 31 time the services are provided.  Health care services provided
 10 32 through in=person consultations or through telehealth are
 10 33 to be treated as equivalent services for the purposes of
 10 34 reimbursement.
 10 35    The bill directs the department of public health, in
 11  1 collaboration with the department of human services and the
 11  2 insurance division of the department of commerce, to convene
 11  3 and conduct a study regarding options for implementing
 11  4 telehealth and telehealth coverage and reimbursement.  The
 11  5 department of public health is directed to submit a final
