  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a

  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues

  5 12    4.  Twenty=three percent of the moneys in each fund shall be
  5 13 used to support the following initiatives:

  5 15 preserves, forests, wildlife areas, wildlife habitats, native

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  6 13 vegetation cover, filter strips, grass waterways, and riparian
  6 14 forest buffers; dredging; and bank stabilization.
  6 15    7.  Thirteen percent of the moneys in each fund shall be used
  6 16 as follows:
  6 17    a.  Fifty=two percent shall be used to support initiatives
  6 18 involving the acquisition, protection, and development of

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  6  7 section 384.80.
  6  8    (2)  Regional and community watershed assessment, planning,
  6  9 and prioritization efforts, including as provided in chapter
  6 10 466B.

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 18 to support public lake restoration initiatives.  An initiative
  7 19 shall account for a lake's recreational, environmental,
  7 20 aesthetic, ecological, and social value, and must improve water
  7 21 quality.
  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues

  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 21 quality.

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 22                           EXPLANATION
  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 25    The bill also amends the calculation for determining
  8 26 the funding of urban renewal projects to ensure that such
  8 27 calculation is not impacted by local option sales tax revenues
  8 28 collected on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one
  8 29 percent.

  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory

  7 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 25    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 26 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 27 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 28    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 29 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 30 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 31 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 32 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 33 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 34 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 35 rate may not exceed one percent.
  8  1 Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  2 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  3 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  4 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  5 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  6 property tax revenues.
  8  7    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  8 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  9 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8 10 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 11 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 12 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 13 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 14 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 15 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 16 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 17    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 18 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 19 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 20 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 21 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 22 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 23 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 24 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
