  3  5 section 403.19A, subsection 1, applies to withholding
  3  6 agreements entered into on or after July 1, 2015, and
  3  7 withholding agreements entered into before July 1, 2015, shall
  3  8 be governed by section 403.19A, subsection 1, Code 2015.
  3  9                           EXPLANATION
  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill relates to the targeted jobs withholding tax
  3 13 credit pilot project, which is a program that allows pilot
  3 14 project cities to enter into withholding agreements with
  3 15 businesses that meet certain job creation, capital investment,
  3 16 and private financial support requirements within the city.
  3 17 Withholding agreements provide for the diversion of a certain
  3 18 percentage of the gross wages paid by the business to the pilot
  3 19 project city for a project related to the employer pursuant to
  3 20 the agreement.
  3 21    Under current law, the program is restricted to four pilot
  3 22 project cities; one in a county bordering Nebraska, one in a
  3 23 county bordering South Dakota, and two in counties bordering
  3 24 states other than Nebraska or South Dakota.  However, a county
  3 25 with a population of less than 45,000 residents may count
  3 26 two cities as one pilot project city.  The current pilot
  3 27 project cities are Sioux City, Fort Madison, Council Bluffs,
  3 28 Burlington, and Keokuk.
  3 29    The bill amends the requirement that eligible cities contain
  3 30 three or more census tracts to specify that eligible cities
  3 31 wholly contain three or more census tracts.
  3 32    The bill allows two additional eligible cities to be
  3 33 designated as pilot project cities, one from a county that
  3 34 borders Illinois and one from a county that borders Wisconsin.
  3 35 In order to qualify, the city bordering Illinois must have a
  4  1 population of 86,500 to 110,000 residents, and must be located
  4  2 in a county with a population of 120,000 to 170,000 residents,
  4  3 as determined by the 2010 certified federal census.  The city
  4  4 bordering Wisconsin must have a population of 55,000 to 65,000
  4  5 residents, and must be located in a county with a population of
  4  6 90,000 to 97,000 residents, as determined by the 2010 certified
  4  7 federal census. The bill allows applications from eligible
  4  8 cities for designation as these pilot project cities to be
  4  9 filed before January 1, 2016.
  4 10    The bill also changes the types of businesses that are
  4 11 eligible to enter into withholding agreements under the
  4 12 program.  Under current law, any business enterprise located in
  4 13 Iowa and operated for profit and under single management may
  4 14 qualify unless the business is a retail operation, government
  4 15 entity, or is closing or substantially reducing its operations
  4 16 in another area of the state.
  4 17    The bill provides that only businesses that are
  4 18 manufacturing or industrial enterprises located in Iowa
  4 19 and operated for profit and under single management may
  4 20 qualify under the program.  Excluded are retail operations,
  4 21 professional services, government entities, or any other
  4 22 enterprise that is not primarily engaged in manufacturing or
  4 23 industrial operations, or that is closing or substantially
  4 24 reducing its operations in another area of the state.  This
  4 25 provision applies to withholding agreements entered into on or
  4 26 after July 1, 2015.

  3  3 subsection.
  3  4    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  The section of this Act amending
  3  5 section 403.19A, subsection 1, applies to withholding
  3  6 agreements entered into on or after July 1, 2015, and

  3  9                           EXPLANATION
  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill relates to the targeted jobs withholding tax
  3 13 credit pilot project, which is a program that allows pilot
  3 14 project cities to enter into withholding agreements with
  3 15 businesses that meet certain job creation, capital investment,
  3 16 and private financial support requirements within the city.
  3 17 Withholding agreements provide for the diversion of a certain
  3 18 percentage of the gross wages paid by the business to the pilot
  3 19 project city for a project related to the employer pursuant to
  3 20 the agreement.
  3 21    Under current law, the program is restricted to four pilot
  3 22 project cities; one in a county bordering Nebraska, one in a
  3 23 county bordering South Dakota, and two in counties bordering
  3 24 states other than Nebraska or South Dakota.  However, a county
  3 25 with a population of less than 45,000 residents may count
  3 26 two cities as one pilot project city.  The current pilot
  3 27 project cities are Sioux City, Fort Madison, Council Bluffs,
  3 28 Burlington, and Keokuk.
  3 29    The bill amends the requirement that eligible cities contain
  3 30 three or more census tracts to specify that eligible cities
  3 31 wholly contain three or more census tracts.
  3 32    The bill allows two additional eligible cities to be
  3 33 designated as pilot project cities, one from a county that
  3 34 borders Illinois and one from a county that borders Wisconsin.
  3 35 In order to qualify, the city bordering Illinois must have a
  4  1 population of 86,500 to 110,000 residents, and must be located
  4  2 in a county with a population of 120,000 to 170,000 residents,
  4  3 as determined by the 2010 certified federal census.  The city
  4  4 bordering Wisconsin must have a population of 55,000 to 65,000
  4  5 residents, and must be located in a county with a population of
  4  6 90,000 to 97,000 residents, as determined by the 2010 certified
  4  7 federal census. The bill allows applications from eligible
  4  8 cities for designation as these pilot project cities to be
  4  9 filed before January 1, 2016.
  4 10    The bill also changes the types of businesses that are
  4 11 eligible to enter into withholding agreements under the
  4 12 program.  Under current law, any business enterprise located in
  4 13 Iowa and operated for profit and under single management may
  4 14 qualify unless the business is a retail operation, government
  4 15 entity, or is closing or substantially reducing its operations
  4 16 in another area of the state.
  4 17    The bill provides that only businesses that are
  4 18 manufacturing or industrial enterprises located in Iowa
  4 19 and operated for profit and under single management may
  4 20 qualify under the program.  Excluded are retail operations,
  4 21 professional services, government entities, or any other
  4 22 enterprise that is not primarily engaged in manufacturing or
  4 23 industrial operations, or that is closing or substantially
  4 24 reducing its operations in another area of the state.  This
  4 25 provision applies to withholding agreements entered into on or
