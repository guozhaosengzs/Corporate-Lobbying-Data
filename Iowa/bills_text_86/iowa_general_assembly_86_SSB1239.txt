Since
the

beginning
July

2011,
school
7


districts
have
used
the
Iowa
assessments
developed
by
Iowa
8


testing
programs
(ITP),
a
research,
development,
and
outreach
9


unit
in
the
college
of
education
at
the
university
of
Iowa.

was
responsible
for
creating
and
11


administering
the
Iowa
test
of
basic
skills
and
the
Iowa

12


of
educational
development.
In
recent
years,
ITP
modified
13


these
tests
and
renamed
them
the
Iowa
assessments.
14


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
15


section
25B.3.

bill
requires
that
the
state
cost
of

any
state
mandate
included
in
the
bill
be
paid
by
a
school
17


district
from
state
school
foundation
aid
received
by
the
18


school
district
under
Code
section
257.16.
The
specification
19


is
deemed
to
constitute
state
compliance
with
any
state
mandate
20


funding-related
requirements
of
Code
section
25B.2.
The
21


inclusion
of
this
specification
is
intended
to
reinstate
the
22


requirement
of
political
subdivisions
to
comply
with
any
state
23


mandates
included
in
the
bill.
