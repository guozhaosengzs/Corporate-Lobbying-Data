  7  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7  6    This bill modifies the rebate of state sales tax to the owner
  7  7 or operator of a baseball and softball tournament facility and
  7  8 movie site and makes the rebate subject to an award by the
  7  9 vision Iowa board.
  7 10    BACKGROUND.  2012 Iowa Acts, chapter 1098, enacted a sales
  7 11 tax rebate to the owner or operator of a baseball and softball
  7 12 tournament facility and movie site (facility).  In order to
  7 13 be eligible for the rebate, the facility must be located on a
  7 14 maximum of 279 acres and located inside or within three miles
  7 15 of the city limits of a city with a population between 4,000
  7 16 and 5,500, which is located in a county with a population
  7 17 between 93,000 and 100,000.  Construction on the facility
  7 18 must commence not later than July 1, 2013, and the cost of
  7 19 construction must be at least $38 million.
  7 20    The rebate only applies to state sales tax collected at
  7 21 the facility between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2023.
  7 22 The rebate ceases if control of the facility changes.  The
  7 23 rebate provision is repealed June 30, 2024, or 30 days after a
  7 24 total of $16.5 million has been rebated, or 30 days following
  7 25 the change of control causing the rebates to cease, whichever
  7 26 occurs earlier.
  7 27    CHANGES IN BILL.  The bill changes the name of the qualifying
  7 28 "baseball and softball tournament facility and movie site" to a
  7 29 "baseball and softball complex", changes the requirements to
  7 30 qualify for the sales tax rebate, and makes the rebate subject
  7 31 to an award by the vision Iowa board (board).
  7 32    An entity that is or will become the owner or operator of
  7 33 a baseball and softball complex and that has or is making an
  7 34 application to the economic development authority (EDA) for
  7 35 financial assistance under the community attraction and tourism
  8  1 program (CAT program) is eligible to apply for the sales tax
  8  2 rebate in the same manner and form as an application for the
  8  3 CAT program is made.  However, a project for a baseball and
  8  4 softball complex is not required to be receiving financial
  8  5 assistance under another part of the CAT program in order to
  8  6 be awarded a sales tax rebate.  In order to be eligible for a
  8  7 rebate award, the project upon completion will be a baseball
  8  8 and softball complex.  Applications are reviewed by the EDA in
  8  9 the same manner as applications under the CAT program, except
  8 10 that the EDA is not required to consider whether the applicant
  8 11 has received financial assistance under the CAT program for the
  8 12 same project.  Upon review of the application, the EDA makes a
  8 13 recommendation to the board and the board approves, defers, or
  8 14 denies the application.  The board shall not award more than
  8 15 $2.5 million in sales tax rebates for any one baseball and
  8 16 softball complex and shall not award more than $16.5 million
  8 17 in total sales tax rebates for all baseball and softball
  8 18 complexes.  The sales tax rebate award provisions are repealed
  8 19 30 days after the board awards a total of $16.5 million in
  8 20 sales tax rebates. A baseball and softball complex that has
  8 21 received an award qualifies for the sales tax rebate if it is
  8 22 located in this state, has a project completion date that is
  8 23 after July 1, 2016, and has construction costs of at least $10
  8 24 million.  "Project completion date" is defined in the bill to
  8 25 mean the date on which the baseball and softball complex is
  8 26 placed into service.
  8 27    The bill removes the requirement that the legal entity
  8 28 that is the owner or operator of the complex be a for=profit
  8 29 legal entity, and further modifies the percentage=of=ownership
  8 30 requirements for qualification as an owner or operator and
  8 31 for the occurrence of a change of control to specify that the
  8 32 percentage is calculated using the equity interests or voting
  8 33 interest owned or controlled by Iowa residents.  Under current
  8 34 law, the calculation only considers equity interests owned by
  8 35 Iowa residents.
  9  1 The bill changes the availability of the sales tax rebate for
  9  2 each baseball and softball complex that has received an award
  9  3 to specify that the rebate only applies to sales tax collected
  9  4 for the period that begins on the complex's project completion
  9  5 date or the date on which the rebate award was made, whichever
  9  6 is later, and that ends on the date which is 10 years after the
  9  7 complex's project completion date.
  9  8    The bill specifies that the amount of sales tax rebates paid
  9  9 to a baseball and softball complex cannot exceed the amount
  9 10 of the rebate award made by the board.  The bill changes the
  9 11 repeal date of the rebate provision to provide that the rebate
  9 12 is repealed 30 days after a total of $16.5 million has been
  9 13 rebated.

  7 17 between 93,000 and 100,000.  Construction on the facility
  7 18 must commence not later than July 1, 2013, and the cost of
  7 19 construction must be at least $38 million.
  7 20    The rebate only applies to state sales tax collected at
  7 21 the facility between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2023.
  7 22 The rebate ceases if control of the facility changes.  The
  7 23 rebate provision is repealed June 30, 2024, or 30 days after a

  7 25 the change of control causing the rebates to cease, whichever
  7 26 occurs earlier.
  7 27    CHANGES IN BILL.  The bill changes the name of the qualifying

  8  4 softball complex is not required to be receiving financial

  8  6 be awarded a sales tax rebate.  In order to be eligible for a
  8  7 rebate award, the project upon completion will be a baseball
  8  8 and softball complex.  Applications are reviewed by the EDA in
  8  9 the same manner as applications under the CAT program, except
  8 10 that the EDA is not required to consider whether the applicant
  8 11 has received financial assistance under the CAT program for the
  8 12 same project.  Upon review of the application, the EDA makes a
  8 13 recommendation to the board and the board approves, defers, or
  8 14 denies the application.  The board shall not award more than
  8 15 $2.5 million in sales tax rebates for any one baseball and
  8 16 softball complex and shall not award more than $16.5 million
  8 17 in total sales tax rebates for all baseball and softball
  8 18 complexes.  The sales tax rebate award provisions are repealed
  8 19 30 days after the board awards a total of $16.5 million in
  8 20 sales tax rebates. A baseball and softball complex that has
  8 21 received an award qualifies for the sales tax rebate if it is
  8 22 located in this state, has a project completion date that is
  8 23 after July 1, 2016, and has construction costs of at least $10
  8 24 million.  "Project completion date" is defined in the bill to

  7 10    BACKGROUND.  2012 Iowa Acts, chapter 1098, enacted a sales

  7 18 must commence not later than July 1, 2013, and the cost of

  7 20    The rebate only applies to state sales tax collected at
  7 21 the facility between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2023.
  7 22 The rebate ceases if control of the facility changes.  The

  7 24 total of $16.5 million has been rebated, or 30 days following
  7 25 the change of control causing the rebates to cease, whichever
  7 26 occurs earlier.
  7 27    CHANGES IN BILL.  The bill changes the name of the qualifying
  7 28 "baseball and softball tournament facility and movie site" to a
  7 29 "baseball and softball complex", changes the requirements to
  7 30 qualify for the sales tax rebate, and makes the rebate subject

  7 32    An entity that is or will become the owner or operator of
  7 33 a baseball and softball complex and that has or is making an
  7 34 application to the economic development authority (EDA) for
  7 35 financial assistance under the community attraction and tourism
  8  1 program (CAT program) is eligible to apply for the sales tax
  8  2 rebate in the same manner and form as an application for the
  8  3 CAT program is made.  However, a project for a baseball and
  8  4 softball complex is not required to be receiving financial
  8  5 assistance under another part of the CAT program in order to
  8  6 be awarded a sales tax rebate.  In order to be eligible for a
  8  7 rebate award, the project upon completion will be a baseball
  8  8 and softball complex.  Applications are reviewed by the EDA in
  8  9 the same manner as applications under the CAT program, except
  8 10 that the EDA is not required to consider whether the applicant
  8 11 has received financial assistance under the CAT program for the
  8 12 same project.  Upon review of the application, the EDA makes a
  8 13 recommendation to the board and the board approves, defers, or
  8 14 denies the application.  The board shall not award more than
  8 15 $2.5 million in sales tax rebates for any one baseball and
  8 16 softball complex and shall not award more than $16.5 million
  8 17 in total sales tax rebates for all baseball and softball
  8 18 complexes.  The sales tax rebate award provisions are repealed
  8 19 30 days after the board awards a total of $16.5 million in
  8 20 sales tax rebates. A baseball and softball complex that has
  8 21 received an award qualifies for the sales tax rebate if it is
  8 22 located in this state, has a project completion date that is
  8 23 after July 1, 2016, and has construction costs of at least $10
  8 24 million.  "Project completion date" is defined in the bill to
  8 25 mean the date on which the baseball and softball complex is
  8 26 placed into service.
  8 27    The bill removes the requirement that the legal entity
  8 28 that is the owner or operator of the complex be a for=profit
  8 29 legal entity, and further modifies the percentage=of=ownership
  8 30 requirements for qualification as an owner or operator and
  8 31 for the occurrence of a change of control to specify that the
  8 32 percentage is calculated using the equity interests or voting
  8 33 interest owned or controlled by Iowa residents.  Under current
  8 34 law, the calculation only considers equity interests owned by

  8 22 located in this state, has a project completion date that is
  8 23 after July 1, 2016, and has construction costs of at least $10

  8 33 interest owned or controlled by Iowa residents.  Under current

  8 24 million.  "Project completion date" is defined in the bill to

  8 27    The bill removes the requirement that the legal entity

  8 33 interest owned or controlled by Iowa residents.  Under current
