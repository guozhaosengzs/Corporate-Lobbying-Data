 27 17 to read as follows:
 27 18    4.  For valuations established as of January 1, 1979,
 27 19 the percentage of actual value at which agricultural and
 27 20 residential property shall be assessed shall be the quotient
 27 21 of the dividend and divisor as defined in this section. The
 27 22 dividend for each class of property shall be the dividend
 27 23 as determined for each class of property for valuations
 27 24 established as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product
 27 25 obtained by multiplying the percentage determined for that
 27 26 year by the amount of any additions or deletions to actual
 27 27 value, excluding those resulting from the revaluation of
 27 28 existing properties, as reported by the assessors on the
 27 29 abstracts of assessment for 1978, plus six percent of the
 27 30 amount so determined. However, if the difference between the
 27 31 dividend so determined for either class of property and the
 27 32 dividend for that class of property for valuations established
 27 33 as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by
 27 34 multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the
 27 35 amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding
 28  1 those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties,
 28  2 as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment
 28  3 for 1978, is less than six percent, the 1979 dividend for the
 28  4 other class of property shall be the dividend as determined for
 28  5 that class of property for valuations established as of January
 28  6 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying
 28  7 the percentage determined for that year by the amount of
 28  8 any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those
 28  9 resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as
 28 10 reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for
 28 11 1978, plus a percentage of the amount so determined which is
 28 12 equal to the percentage by which the dividend as determined
 28 13 for the other class of property for valuations established
 28 14 as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by
 28 15 multiplying the percentage determined for that year by the
 28 16 amount of any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding
 28 17 those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties,
 28 18 as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment
 28 19 for 1978, is increased in arriving at the 1979 dividend for
 28 20 the other class of property. The divisor for each class of
 28 21 property shall be the total actual value of all such property
 28 22 in the state in the preceding year, as reported by the
 28 23 assessors on the abstracts of assessment submitted for 1978,
 28 24 plus the amount of value added to said total actual value by
 28 25 the revaluation of existing properties in 1979 as equalized
 28 26 by the director of revenue pursuant to section 441.49. The
 28 27 director shall utilize information reported on abstracts of
 28 28 assessment submitted pursuant to section 441.45 in determining
 28 29 such percentage. For valuations established as of January 1,
 28 30 1980, and each assessment year thereafter beginning before
 28 31 January 1, 2013, the percentage of actual value as equalized
 28 32 by the director of revenue as provided in section 441.49 at
 28 33 which agricultural and residential property shall be assessed
 28 34 shall be calculated in accordance with the methods provided
 28 35 in this subsection, including the limitation of increases in

 29  2 increase of the other class of property if the other class
 29  3 increases less than the allowable limit adjusted to include
 29  4 the applicable and current values as equalized by the director
 29  5 of revenue, except that any references to six percent in this
 29  6 subsection shall be four percent. For valuations established
 29  7 as of January 1, 2013, and each assessment year thereafter,

 27 19 the percentage of actual value at which agricultural and
 27 20 residential property shall be assessed shall be the quotient
 27 21 of the dividend and divisor as defined in this section. The

 27 23 as determined for each class of property for valuations
 27 24 established as of January 1, 1978, adjusted by the product
 27 25 obtained by multiplying the percentage determined for that

 28  3 for 1978, is less than six percent, the 1979 dividend for the
 28  4 other class of property shall be the dividend as determined for
 28  5 that class of property for valuations established as of January
 28  6 1, 1978, adjusted by the product obtained by multiplying
 28  7 the percentage determined for that year by the amount of
 28  8 any additions or deletions to actual value, excluding those
 28  9 resulting from the revaluation of existing properties, as
 28 10 reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment for

 28 17 those resulting from the revaluation of existing properties,
 28 18 as reported by the assessors on the abstracts of assessment
 28 19 for 1978, is increased in arriving at the 1979 dividend for
 28 20 the other class of property. The divisor for each class of
 28 21 property shall be the total actual value of all such property
 28 22 in the state in the preceding year, as reported by the
 28 23 assessors on the abstracts of assessment submitted for 1978,
 28 24 plus the amount of value added to said total actual value by
 28 25 the revaluation of existing properties in 1979 as equalized
 28 26 by the director of revenue pursuant to section 441.49. The
 28 27 director shall utilize information reported on abstracts of
 28 28 assessment submitted pursuant to section 441.45 in determining
 28 29 such percentage. For valuations established as of January 1,

 28 32 by the director of revenue as provided in section 441.49 at
 28 33 which agricultural and residential property shall be assessed
 28 34 shall be calculated in accordance with the methods provided
 28 35 in this subsection, including the limitation of increases in

 37 23    DIVISION I == FUTURE REPEAL OF STATE BOARD OF TAX REVIEW
 37 24 == TRANSITION.  Division I provides for the future repeal of
 37 25 the state board of tax review.  The state board of tax review
 37 26 (board) is an independent, bipartisan board consisting of
 37 27 three members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the
 37 28 senate.  One of the powers and duties of the board is to review
 37 29 final decisions of the director, including but not limited
 37 30 to final decisions issued by the director in a contested
 37 31 case proceeding.  The board also has original jurisdiction
 37 32 to review the director's assessments of centrally assessed
 37 33 property, which means the taxpayer appeals the assessment of
 37 34 the director directly to the board.  An appeal must be made to
 37 35 the board within 30 days of a director's decision in order to
 38  1 be considered timely. Both the taxpayer and the director have
 38  2 the right to appeal a decision of the board to district court.
 38  3    The division prohibits the board from accepting cases for
 38  4 review, and prohibits a taxpayer from filing an appeal with the
 38  5 board, on or after the effective date of the division.  The
 38  6 board is repealed and dissolved on the date that it disposes of
 38  7 all pending cases or on July 1, 2016, whichever occurs earlier.
 38  8 The division takes effect immediately upon enactment.

 38 13    The division removes members of the board from the
 38 14 requirement to file certain financial statements with the
 38 15 ethics and campaign disclosure board. The division also
 38 16 strikes references to the board from the ability of a
 38 17 prevailing taxpayer to be awarded litigation costs in certain
 38 18 proceedings.  These provisions take effect July 1, 2016.
 38 19    The division amends the procedures for appealing the
 38 20 director's disallowance, recalculation, or denial of a
 38 21 homestead property tax credit, property tax credit or rent
 38 22 reimbursement for elderly and disabled, military service
 38 23 property tax exemption, or business property tax credit.
 38 24 Current law provides that these decisions are made by the
 38 25 director and may be appealed to the board.  The division
 38 26 provides that these decisions will be made by the department
 38 27 of revenue (department) and may be appealed to the director
 38 28 within 30 days of the notice of disallowance, recalculation,
 38 29 or denial.  If such an appeal is made, the director is
 38 30 required to grant a hearing and determine the correctness of
 38 31 the disallowance, recalculation, or denial. The director's
 38 32 decisions are subject to judicial review.
 38 33    The division amends procedures and rules for appealing the
 38 34 director's assessment of telegraph and telephone companies
 38 35 (Code chapter 433), railway companies (Code chapter 434),
 39  1 electric transmission line companies (Code chapter 437),
 39  2 pipeline companies (Code chapter 438), and certain other
 39  3 property assessed by the director (Code chapter 428).
 39  4 Current law provides that these tax assessments are made by
 39  5 the director and shall be appealed directly to the board,
 39  6 and provides for certain additional rules that apply to
 39  7 proceedings before the board.  The division provides that
 39  8 these tax assessments will be made by the department and shall
 39  9 be appealed to the director and provides that the existing
 39 10 additional rules shall apply to appeal proceedings before the
 39 11 director. The director's decisions are subject to judicial
 39 12 review.
 39 13    The division specifies that a city or county conference
 39 14 board may seek judicial review of the decision of the director
 39 15 following a hearing to determine a city or county assessor's
 39 16 noncompliance with the rules for valuation of property.
 39 17 The division also amends the procedures for appealing a
 39 18 determination by the department of revenue that an assessor
 39 19 remains in noncompliance following a plan of action by a
 39 20 conference board to achieve compliance.  Current law provides
 39 21 that such a determination may be appealed to the board.  The
 39 22 division provides that the decision may be appealed to the
 39 23 director within 30 days of the notice of noncompliance.  The
 39 24 director is required to grant a hearing and determine the
 39 25 correctness of the noncompliance determination.  Judicial
 39 26 review may be sought by the chairperson of the conference
 39 27 board.
 39 28    The division amends the procedures for equalizing property
 39 29 and appealing a final equalization order of the director.
 39 30 Current law provides that the equalization of property and the
 39 31 issuance of equalization orders are done by the director and
 39 32 that such orders may be appealed to the board.  The division
 39 33 provides that the equalization of property will be done by the
 39 34 department and that the equalization orders will be issued
 39 35 by the department and may be appealed to the director.  The
 40  1 director is required to grant a hearing and determine the
 40  2 correctness of the final equalization order.  Judicial review
 40  3 of the director's decision may be sought by the city or county
 40  4 officials.
 40  5    The division also amends the duties and powers of the
 40  6 director with regard to the appeal of a final equalization
 40  7 order.  Current law provides that certain rules relating to
 40  8 contested case proceedings in Code chapter 17A (administrative
 40  9 procedures Act) do not apply to matters involving the
 40 10 equalization of property, except in a hearing before the board.
 40 11 The division provides that the contested case proceeding rules
 40 12 will apply in a hearing before the director from an appeal of a
 40 13 final equalization order, and provides for the future repeal on
 40 14 July 1, 2016, of the reference to the board's exemption from
 40 15 those rules.

 37 24 == TRANSITION.  Division I provides for the future repeal of
 37 25 the state board of tax review.  The state board of tax review
 37 26 (board) is an independent, bipartisan board consisting of
 37 27 three members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the
 37 28 senate.  One of the powers and duties of the board is to review
 37 29 final decisions of the director, including but not limited
 37 30 to final decisions issued by the director in a contested
 37 31 case proceeding.  The board also has original jurisdiction
 37 32 to review the director's assessments of centrally assessed
 37 33 property, which means the taxpayer appeals the assessment of
 37 34 the director directly to the board.  An appeal must be made to
 37 35 the board within 30 days of a director's decision in order to
 38  1 be considered timely. Both the taxpayer and the director have
 38  2 the right to appeal a decision of the board to district court.
 38  3    The division prohibits the board from accepting cases for
 38  4 review, and prohibits a taxpayer from filing an appeal with the
 38  5 board, on or after the effective date of the division.  The

 38  7 all pending cases or on July 1, 2016, whichever occurs earlier.
 38  8 The division takes effect immediately upon enactment.

 38 13    The division removes members of the board from the
 38 14 requirement to file certain financial statements with the
 38 15 ethics and campaign disclosure board. The division also
 38 16 strikes references to the board from the ability of a

 38 18 proceedings.  These provisions take effect July 1, 2016.

 38 20 director's disallowance, recalculation, or denial of a
 38 21 homestead property tax credit, property tax credit or rent
 38 22 reimbursement for elderly and disabled, military service
 38 23 property tax exemption, or business property tax credit.
 38 24 Current law provides that these decisions are made by the
 38 25 director and may be appealed to the board.  The division
 38 26 provides that these decisions will be made by the department
 38 27 of revenue (department) and may be appealed to the director
 38 28 within 30 days of the notice of disallowance, recalculation,
 38 29 or denial.  If such an appeal is made, the director is
 38 30 required to grant a hearing and determine the correctness of
 38 31 the disallowance, recalculation, or denial. The director's
 38 32 decisions are subject to judicial review.
 38 33    The division amends procedures and rules for appealing the
 38 34 director's assessment of telegraph and telephone companies
 38 35 (Code chapter 433), railway companies (Code chapter 434),
 39  1 electric transmission line companies (Code chapter 437),
 39  2 pipeline companies (Code chapter 438), and certain other
 39  3 property assessed by the director (Code chapter 428).
 39  4 Current law provides that these tax assessments are made by
 39  5 the director and shall be appealed directly to the board,
 39  6 and provides for certain additional rules that apply to
 39  7 proceedings before the board.  The division provides that
 39  8 these tax assessments will be made by the department and shall
 39  9 be appealed to the director and provides that the existing
 39 10 additional rules shall apply to appeal proceedings before the
 39 11 director. The director's decisions are subject to judicial
 39 12 review.
 39 13    The division specifies that a city or county conference
 39 14 board may seek judicial review of the decision of the director
 39 15 following a hearing to determine a city or county assessor's
 39 16 noncompliance with the rules for valuation of property.
 39 17 The division also amends the procedures for appealing a
 39 18 determination by the department of revenue that an assessor
 39 19 remains in noncompliance following a plan of action by a

 39 21 that such a determination may be appealed to the board.  The
 39 22 division provides that the decision may be appealed to the
 39 23 director within 30 days of the notice of noncompliance.  The
 39 24 director is required to grant a hearing and determine the

 39 27 board.

 39 30 Current law provides that the equalization of property and the

 39 33 provides that the equalization of property will be done by the
 39 34 department and that the equalization orders will be issued
 39 35 by the department and may be appealed to the director.  The
 40  1 director is required to grant a hearing and determine the
 40  2 correctness of the final equalization order.  Judicial review
 40  3 of the director's decision may be sought by the city or county
 40  4 officials.
 40  5    The division also amends the duties and powers of the
 40  6 director with regard to the appeal of a final equalization
 40  7 order.  Current law provides that certain rules relating to
 40  8 contested case proceedings in Code chapter 17A (administrative
 40  9 procedures Act) do not apply to matters involving the
 40 10 equalization of property, except in a hearing before the board.
 40 11 The division provides that the contested case proceeding rules
 40 12 will apply in a hearing before the director from an appeal of a
 40 13 final equalization order, and provides for the future repeal on

 37 23    DIVISION I == FUTURE REPEAL OF STATE BOARD OF TAX REVIEW
 37 24 == TRANSITION.  Division I provides for the future repeal of
 37 25 the state board of tax review.  The state board of tax review
 37 26 (board) is an independent, bipartisan board consisting of
 37 27 three members appointed by the governor and confirmed by the
 37 28 senate.  One of the powers and duties of the board is to review
 37 29 final decisions of the director, including but not limited
 37 30 to final decisions issued by the director in a contested
 37 31 case proceeding.  The board also has original jurisdiction
 37 32 to review the director's assessments of centrally assessed
 37 33 property, which means the taxpayer appeals the assessment of
 37 34 the director directly to the board.  An appeal must be made to
 37 35 the board within 30 days of a director's decision in order to
 38  1 be considered timely. Both the taxpayer and the director have
 38  2 the right to appeal a decision of the board to district court.
 38  3    The division prohibits the board from accepting cases for
 38  4 review, and prohibits a taxpayer from filing an appeal with the
 38  5 board, on or after the effective date of the division.  The

 38 13    The division removes members of the board from the
 38 14 requirement to file certain financial statements with the
 38 15 ethics and campaign disclosure board. The division also
 38 16 strikes references to the board from the ability of a
 38 17 prevailing taxpayer to be awarded litigation costs in certain
 38 18 proceedings.  These provisions take effect July 1, 2016.
 38 19    The division amends the procedures for appealing the
 38 20 director's disallowance, recalculation, or denial of a
 38 21 homestead property tax credit, property tax credit or rent
 38 22 reimbursement for elderly and disabled, military service
 38 23 property tax exemption, or business property tax credit.
 38 24 Current law provides that these decisions are made by the
 38 25 director and may be appealed to the board.  The division
 38 26 provides that these decisions will be made by the department
 38 27 of revenue (department) and may be appealed to the director
 38 28 within 30 days of the notice of disallowance, recalculation,
 38 29 or denial.  If such an appeal is made, the director is
 38 30 required to grant a hearing and determine the correctness of
 38 31 the disallowance, recalculation, or denial. The director's
 38 32 decisions are subject to judicial review.
 38 33    The division amends procedures and rules for appealing the
 38 34 director's assessment of telegraph and telephone companies
 38 35 (Code chapter 433), railway companies (Code chapter 434),
 39  1 electric transmission line companies (Code chapter 437),
 39  2 pipeline companies (Code chapter 438), and certain other
 39  3 property assessed by the director (Code chapter 428).
 39  4 Current law provides that these tax assessments are made by
 39  5 the director and shall be appealed directly to the board,
 39  6 and provides for certain additional rules that apply to

 39  8 these tax assessments will be made by the department and shall
 39  9 be appealed to the director and provides that the existing

 39 11 director. The director's decisions are subject to judicial
 39 12 review.
 39 13    The division specifies that a city or county conference
 39 14 board may seek judicial review of the decision of the director
 39 15 following a hearing to determine a city or county assessor's
 39 16 noncompliance with the rules for valuation of property.
 39 17 The division also amends the procedures for appealing a
 39 18 determination by the department of revenue that an assessor
 39 19 remains in noncompliance following a plan of action by a
 39 20 conference board to achieve compliance.  Current law provides
 39 21 that such a determination may be appealed to the board.  The
 39 22 division provides that the decision may be appealed to the
 39 23 director within 30 days of the notice of noncompliance.  The

 39 30 Current law provides that the equalization of property and the
 39 31 issuance of equalization orders are done by the director and
 39 32 that such orders may be appealed to the board.  The division
 39 33 provides that the equalization of property will be done by the
 39 34 department and that the equalization orders will be issued
 39 35 by the department and may be appealed to the director.  The
 40  1 director is required to grant a hearing and determine the
 40  2 correctness of the final equalization order.  Judicial review
 40  3 of the director's decision may be sought by the city or county
 40  4 officials.
 40  5    The division also amends the duties and powers of the
 40  6 director with regard to the appeal of a final equalization
 40  7 order.  Current law provides that certain rules relating to
 40  8 contested case proceedings in Code chapter 17A (administrative
 40  9 procedures Act) do not apply to matters involving the
 40 10 equalization of property, except in a hearing before the board.
 40 11 The division provides that the contested case proceeding rules
 40 12 will apply in a hearing before the director from an appeal of a
