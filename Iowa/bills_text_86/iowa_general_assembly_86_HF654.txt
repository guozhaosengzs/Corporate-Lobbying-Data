  8  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 10    This bill relates to economic development by modifying life
  8 11 cycle cost analysis provisions relating to public facilities,
  8 12 specifying the state matching funds available for payment
  8 13 of intern wages under the science, technology, engineering,
  8 14 and mathematics internship program, and modifying provisions
  8 15 concerning enterprise zones.
  8 16    Division I of the bill modifies provisions relating to the
  8 17 life cycle analysis required of certain public facilities.
  8 18 The division adds a definition of "addition" and modifies the
  8 19 definitions of "facility" and "renovation" and requires a
  8 20 public agency responsible for the construction or renovation
  8 21 of a facility or the construction of an addition to a facility
  8 22 to include the performance of a life cycle cost analysis as
  8 23 a design criterion on or after the effective date of the
  8 24 division.  The division requires a public agency or person
  8 25 preparing a life cycle cost analysis for a public agency to
  8 26 use methodology established, by rule, by the state building
  8 27 code commissioner, rather than methods and analytical
  8 28 models provided by the economic development authority.  The
  8 29 division requires the commissioner to also adopt rules for the
  8 30 implementation and adoption of the life cycle cost analysis.
  8 31    Division II of the bill amends language relating to wages
  8 32 paid to an intern under the science, technology, engineering,
  8 33 and mathematics internship program to specify that an Iowa
  8 34 employer may receive financial assistance from the state on a
  8 35 matching basis.  The division provides that if the authority
  9  1 offers financial assistance for a student at a small or
  9  2 medium sized Iowa firm that is an innovative business or for
  9  3 a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics student
  9  4 working with an Iowa employer, for every $2 earned by the
  9  5 student in wages, the employer's payment of $1 shall be
  9  6 matched by the authority with $1 on a reimbursement basis.
  9  7 The division requires the authority to administer the two
  9  8 components of the internship program in as similar a manner
  9  9 as possible. The division authorizes the authority to adopt
  9 10 emergency rules for this division of the bill.  The division
  9 11 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
  9 12 contracts for financial assistance entered into on or after
  9 13 July 1, 2014.
  9 14    Divisions III and IV of the bill relate to enterprise
  9 15 zones.  Division III allows a city or county and the economic
  9 16 development authority for compliance reasons to amend
  9 17 agreements made under the enterprise zone program as long as
  9 18 the amendments do not increase the amount of incentives awarded
  9 19 and the economic development authority board approves.
  9 20    Division IV allows the authority to enter into an agreement
  9 21 for a housing enterprise tax credit for certain housing
  9 22 businesses that had mailed applications to the authority prior
  9 23 to the July 1, 2014, repeal of the housing enterprise tax
  9 24 credit in Code section 15E.193B.
  9 25    The division states that the authority may enter into
  9 26 an agreement and issue housing enterprise tax credits to a
  9 27 housing business if the city or county mailed the application
  9 28 forms on or after June 1, 2014, and prior to July 1, 2014,
  9 29 but the applications were not received by the authority, the
  9 30 application forms submitted were approved by the necessary
  9 31 governing bodies and commissions, the authority determines
  9 32 the housing business would otherwise be eligible under the
  9 33 Code section that was repealed, and the city or county and the
  9 34 eligible housing business meet all other requirements of the
  9 35 housing enterprise tax credit program and of the agreement
 10  1 entered into with the economic development authority.
