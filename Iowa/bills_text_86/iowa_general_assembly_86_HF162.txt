  1 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 16    This bill adds plasma gasification to the list of preferred
  1 17 pollution prevention measures found in the waste management
  1 18 assistance Act, found in part 9 of division IV of Code
  1 19 chapter 455B.  "Plasma gasification" is defined as the thermal
  1 20 dissociation of carbonaceous materials into fragments of
  1 21 compounds in an oxygen=starved environment producing synthetic
  1 22 gas, either as a stand=alone fuel or by blending with natural
  1 23 gas, the reclamation of metal products for recycling, and the
  1 24 vitrification of inorganic compounds that may be used for
  1 25 manufactured products. The pollution prevention measures would
  1 26 include, in order of most=preferred to least=preferred, source
  1 27 reduction for waste elimination, reuse, on=site recycling,
  1 28 off=site recycling, plasma gasification, waste treatment,
  1 29 combustion with energy recovery, and land disposal.
