26


This

relates

equipment
27


tax
imposed

BACKGROUND.
The
furnishing
of
services
connected
to
30


construction
are
generally
exempt
from

sales
and

31


Instead,
owners,
contractors,
subcontractors,
and
builders
are
32


treated
as
consumers
or
users
for
purposes
of
the
sales
and
33


use
tax
and
pay
tax
on
the
building
materials,
supplies,
and
34


equipment
they
purchase
and
use
in
furnishing
construction

services,
except
under
certain
circumstances,
two
of
which
are
1


addressed
in
the
bill.
2


SALES
AND
USE
TAX
ON
CONSTRUCTION
EQUIPMENT.
Under
3


current
law
in
Code
section
423.3(37),
the
lease
or
rental
4


of
machinery,
equipment,
and
replacement
parts
(construction
5


equipment)
directly
and
primarily
used
in
specified
6


construction
services
by
an
owner,
contractor,
subcontractor,
7


or
builder
is
exempt
from
the
sales
and
use
tax.
The
bill
8


strikes
the
requirement
that
the
construction
equipment
be
used
9


directly
in
the
construction
service
in
order
to
qualify
for
10


the
exemption.
11


Also
under
current
law
in
Code
section
423.3(2),
the
sale
12


of
tangible
personal
property
for
subsequent
resale,
lease,
or
13


rental
is
exempt
from
the
sales
and
use
tax
(sale-for-resale
14


exemption).
However,
the
sale
of
construction
equipment
for
15


a
subsequent
lease
or
rental
that
will
qualify
for
the
tax
16


exemption
in
Code
section
423.3(37),
as
described
above,
does
17


not
qualify
for
the
sale-for-resale
exemption.
The
bill
18


strikes
this
provision.
The
sale
for
subsequent
lease
or
19


rental
of
construction
equipment
primarily
used
in
a
specified
20


construction
service
by
owners,
contractors,
subcontractors,
21


and
builders
will
now
be
exempt
from
the
sales
and
use
tax.
22


EXCISE
TAX
ON
HEAVY
CONSTRUCTION
EQUIPMENT.
Under
current
23


law
in
Code
section
423.3(85),
the
sale
of
self-propelled
24


building
equipment,
pile
drivers,
motorized
scaffolding,
and
25


attachments
(heavy
construction
equipment)
that
are
directly
26


and
primarily
used
by
a
contractor,
subcontractor,
or
builder
27


in
specified
construction
services
are
exempt
from
the
sales
28


and
use
tax.
Instead,
this
heavy
construction
equipment
is
29


subject
to
an
excise
tax
of
5
percent
under
Code
chapter
423D
30


(equipment
tax)
imposed
on
all
equipment
sold
or
used
in
Iowa.
31


The
bill
amends
the
sales
and
use
tax
exemption
in
Code
32


section
423.3(85)
to
remove
the
requirement
that
the
heavy
33


construction
equipment
be
directly
and
primarily
used
by
34


a
contractor,
subcontractor,
or

_____


construction
service
to
qualify
for
the
exemption.
A
sale
of
1


heavy
construction
equipment
will
now
qualify
for
the
sales
and
2


use
tax
exemption
in
Code
section
423.3(85)
if
it
is
sold
to
a
3


contractor,
as
defined
under
the
equipment
tax
and
as
amended
4


in
the
bill.
5


The
bill
makes
several
changes
to
the
equipment
tax
in
Code
6


chapter
423D.
The
definition
of
“contractor”
is
amended
to
7


mean
a
person
primarily
engaged
in
the
trade
or
business
of
8


acting
as
a
contractor,
subcontractor,
or
builder
of
or
on
real
9


property
or
structures
owned
by
another
person.
The
definition
10


of
“equipment”
is
amended
to
remove
the
requirement
that
it
be
11


directly
and
primarily
used
by
a
contractor,
subcontractor,
12


or
builder
in
specified
construction
services
in
order
to
be
13


subject
to
the
equipment
tax.
14


The
bill
imposes
the
equipment
tax
on
all
equipment
sold
15


or
used
by
a
contractor
in
Iowa.
The
bill
exempts
from
the
16


equipment
tax
the
sale
for
resale
of
equipment
to
a
contractor
17


who
is
also
a
retailer,
and
the
lease
or
rental
of
equipment
to
18


a
contractor
for
primary
use
in
construction.
The
bill
also
19


exempts
the
use
of
equipment
from
the
tax
if
the
equipment
20


tax
has
already
been
paid
by
the
contractor
on
the
purchase
21


of
that
equipment.
Finally,
the
bill
provides
a
credit
equal
22


to
the
amount
of
similar
tax
paid
in
another
state
by
the
23


same
taxpayer
relating
to
equipment
subject
to
the
equipment
24


tax
in
Iowa.
However,
the
credit
cannot
exceed
the
amount
of
25


equipment
tax
due
in
Iowa
on
the
equipment.
