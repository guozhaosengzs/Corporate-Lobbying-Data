  1  3    The general assembly finds and declares all of the
  1  4 following:
  1  5    1.  Article IX, 2nd, section 3, of the Constitution of
  1  6 the State of Iowa states, in part, that the general assembly
  1  7 shall encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of
  1  8 intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.
  1  9    2.  The leading moral precept for a civil society has been
  1 10 expressed by various philosophies and religions for millennia
  1 11 and is often called the golden rule, as set forth in paragraphs
  1 12 "a" through "g".
  1 13    a.  Confucianism, circa 557 BC, Analects 15:23:
  1 14    What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.
  1 15    b.  Buddhism, circa 560 BC, Udanavarga 5:18:
  1 16    Hurt not others with that which pains yourself.
  1 17    c.  Judaism, circa 1300 BC, the Torah, Leviticus 19:18:
  1 18    Thou shalt Love thy neighbor as thyself.
  1 19    d.  Hinduism, circa 3200 BC, Hitopadesa:
  1 20    One should always treat others as they themselves wish to be
  1 21 treated.
  1 22    e.  Zoroastrianism, circa 600 BC, Shast=na=shayast 13:29:
  1 23    Whatever is disagreeable to yourself, do not do unto others.
  1 24    f.  Christianity, circa 30 AD, the King James Bible, Matthew
  1 25 7:12:
  1 26    Whatsoever ye would that others should do to you, do ye even
  1 27 so to them.
  1 28    g.  Islam, circa 570=632 AD, the Prophet Muhammad, pbuh,
  1 29 Sahih Muslim:
  1 30    None of you have faith until you love for your neighbor what
  1 31 you love for yourself.
  1 32    3.  The golden rule, with roots in a wide range of world
  1 33 cultures, is well suited to be a standard that different
  1 34 cultures can ascribe to in resolving conflicts, and the board
  1 35 of directors of each public school district shall require the
  2  1 display of the golden rule in all public school classrooms.
  2  2                           EXPLANATION
  2  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  5    The general assembly finds and declares in this bill that the
  2  6 leading moral precept for a civil society has been expressed by
  2  7 various philosophies and religions for millennia and is often
  2  8 called the golden rule, which generally states that one should
  2  9 treat others as one wants to be treated. The bill also cites

  2 11 requires the general assembly to encourage, by all suitable
  2 12 means, the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and
  2 13 agricultural improvement.
  2 14    The bill declares that the golden rule, with roots in a
  2 15 wide range of world cultures, is well suited to be a standard
  2 16 that different cultures can ascribe to in resolving conflicts,
  2 17 and the board of directors of each public school district must
  2 18 require the display of the golden rule in all public school
  2 19 classrooms.
