20


BILL.
This
bill
allows
a
person
to
apply
manure
originating
21


from
an
animal
feeding
operation
on
saturated
ground,
unless
22


it
is
liquid
manure
originating
from
a
confinement
feeding
23


operation.
In
that
case,
the
bill
prohibits
the
application
of
24


such
liquid
manure
on
saturated
ground
as
well
as
on
frozen
or
25


snow-covered
ground
regardless
of
the
season.
The
prohibition
26


also
requires
a
24-hour
delay
if
the
national
weather
service
27


forecasts
rain.
The
bill
also
prohibits
a
person
from
applying
28


liquid
manure
originating
from
a
confinement
feeding
operation
29


on
land
having
a
slope
with
a
grade
exceeding
20
percent.
The
30


prohibitions
do
not
apply:
(1)
if
the
manure
originates
from
a
31


small
animal
feeding
operation
or
(2)
the
manure
is
injected
or
32


incorporated.
33


CURRENT
LAW.
Generally,
a
person
may
apply
manure
34


originating
from
an
animal
feeding
operation

or
frozen
ground,
except
during
a
period
beginning
in
winter
1


and
ending
in
early
spring.
However,
an
exception
allows
such
2


application
if
there
is
an
emergency,
the
manure
originates
3


from
a
small
animal
feeding
operation,
or
if
the
manure
is
4


injected
or
incorporated.
The
prohibition
is
enforced
by
the
5


department
of
natural
resources.
6


TERMS.
An
“animal
feeding
operation”
is
a
place
where
7


animals
(cattle,
swine,
horses,
sheep,
chickens,
turkeys,
8


or
fish)
are
confined
for
45
or
more
days
in
a
12-month
9


period.
A
“confinement
feeding
operation”
is
an
animal
feeding
10


operation
in
which
animals
are
confined
in
roofed
areas
(e.g.,
11


buildings).
A
small
animal
feeding
operation
uses
a
formed
12


manure
storage
that
has
less
than
a
500
animal
unit
capacity
13


(e.g.,
1,250
head
of
hogs
weighing
more
than
55
pounds).
14


Injection
is
the
process
of
applying
manure
beneath
the
soil
15


surface
and
incorporation
is
a
process
that
mixes
manure
into
16


the
soil.
17


APPLICABLE
PENALTIES.
A
person
who
applies
liquid
manure
18


in
violation
of
the
bill’s
prohibition
would
be
subject
to
a
19


civil
penalty,
that
may
be
administratively
assessed
by
the
20


department,
in
an
amount
of
not
more
than
$10,000
(Code
section
21


455B.109),
or
judicially
assessed
for
an
amount
not
more
than
22


$5,000
per
each
day
of
the
violation
(Code
section
455B.191).
23


Collected
moneys
would
be
deposited
into
the
watershed
24


improvement
fund
(Code
sections
459.603
and
466A.2).
