  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 18    1.  The section of this Act amending section 429.2.
  8 19    Sec. 22.  APPLICABILITY.  The section of this Act amending
  8 20 section 423.3, subsection 80, applies to purchases  made on or
  8 21 after the effective date of the section of this Act amending
  8 22 section 423.3, subsection 80.
  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  6 30 filed after May 1, 2016, for solar energy systems installed
  6 31 during the 2015 calendar year, shall be eligible for approval
  6 32 under section 422.11L.  Such applications shall be accepted and
  6 33 approved on a first=come, first=served basis and shall first

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  6 29    2.  Applications for the solar energy system tax credit
  6 30 filed after May 1, 2016, for solar energy systems installed
  6 31 during the 2015 calendar year, shall be eligible for approval
  6 32 under section 422.11L.  Such applications shall be accepted and
  6 33 approved on a first=come, first=served basis and shall first
  6 34 be eligible for approval for the tax year during which the
  6 35 application is received, but not before the tax year beginning
  7  1 January 1, 2017.
  7  2    Sec. 13.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  The section of this
  7  3 Act providing for the approval of solar energy tax credit
  7  4 applications filed after May 1 following the year of the
  7  5 installation for solar energy systems installed during the 2014

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.

  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa

  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a

  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall

  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years

 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under

 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  7  4 applications filed after May 1 following the year of the

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 15    Sec. 21.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The following
  8 16 provision or provisions of this Act apply retroactively to May
  8 17 22, 2015:
  8 18    1.  The section of this Act amending section 429.2.
  8 19    Sec. 22.  APPLICABILITY.  The section of this Act amending
  8 20 section 423.3, subsection 80, applies to purchases  made on or
  8 21 after the effective date of the section of this Act amending
  8 22 section 423.3, subsection 80.
  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 10    Sec. 20.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The following
  8 11 provision or provisions of this Act apply retroactively to

  8 18    1.  The section of this Act amending section 429.2.
  8 19    Sec. 22.  APPLICABILITY.  The section of this Act amending
  8 20 section 423.3, subsection 80, applies to purchases  made on or

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.

  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase

 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter

 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 10    Sec. 20.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The following
  8 11 provision or provisions of this Act apply retroactively to
  8 12 applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
  8 13 after June 26, 2015:
  8 14    1.  The sections of this Act amending section 476C.3.
  8 15    Sec. 21.  RETROACTIVE APPLICABILITY.  The following

  8 18    1.  The section of this Act amending section 429.2.
  8 19    Sec. 22.  APPLICABILITY.  The section of this Act amending
  8 20 section 423.3, subsection 80, applies to purchases  made on or
  8 21 after the effective date of the section of this Act amending
  8 22 section 423.3, subsection 80.
  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 20 section 423.3, subsection 80, applies to purchases  made on or
  8 21 after the effective date of the section of this Act amending
  8 22 section 423.3, subsection 80.
  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once

  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an

 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter

 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a

 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas

 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5

 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate

 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not

 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not

 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa

  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal

  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a

 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,

 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon

  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 19    Sec. 22.  APPLICABILITY.  The section of this Act amending
  8 20 section 423.3, subsection 80, applies to purchases  made on or
  8 21 after the effective date of the section of this Act amending
  8 22 section 423.3, subsection 80.
  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a

 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for

 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at

  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department

 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas

 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved

  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean

 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years

 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends

 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 18    1.  The section of this Act amending section 429.2.
  8 19    Sec. 22.  APPLICABILITY.  The section of this Act amending
  8 20 section 423.3, subsection 80, applies to purchases  made on or
  8 21 after the effective date of the section of this Act amending
  8 22 section 423.3, subsection 80.
  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

  8 23                           EXPLANATION
  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to

 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 26    This bill relates to the administration of the tax and
  8 27 related laws by the department of revenue.
  8 28    BACKGROUND CHECKS.  The bill requires an applicant for
  8 29 employment with the department of revenue (department) at
  8 30 the time of application, or a contractor, vendor, employee,
  8 31 or any other individual performing work for the department
  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.

 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply

  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open

  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a

  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If

  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 32 to be subject to a national criminal history check through
  8 33 the federal bureau of investigation (FBI) at least once
  8 34 every 10 years.  The bill directs the department to provide
  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal

  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax

  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved

  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May

  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall

 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under

  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  8 35 fingerprints to the department of public safety for submission
  9  1 through the state criminal history repository to the FBI, and
  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit

  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall

  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for

 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.

  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9  2 requires individuals to authorize release of the results to
  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the

 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply

 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas

 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51

 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9  3 the department.  The department is required to pay the actual
  9  4 costs of the fingerprinting and the criminal history check.
  9  5 The bill provides that the results of a criminal history check
  9  6 are not considered a public record under Code chapter 22 (open
  9  7 records). This provision takes effect upon enactment.
  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait

  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the

 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction

 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa

 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.

 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas

 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified

 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall

  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the

  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the

  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated

 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction

 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter

 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall

  9  8    SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM TAX CREDIT.  The bill amends the Iowa
  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the

  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is

 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the

 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction

 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter

 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the

 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

  9  9 solar energy system tax credit in Code section 422.11L, which
  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9 10 is provided for the installation of a solar energy system in
  9 11 an amount equal to certain percentages of related federal
  9 12 solar energy tax credits.  The bill requires that tax credit
  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a

  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the

  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall

  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to

 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends

 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been

 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the

  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or
 12 20 after June 26, 2015.

  9 13 applications be accepted and approved by the department on a
  9 14 first=come, first=served basis until the maximum tax credit
  9 15 amount that may be claimed each tax year is reached.  If
  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made
  9 34 in 2014, and not before tax year 2017 for installations made in
  9 35 2015.  This provision takes effect upon enactment.
 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to
 10 12 January 1, 2022, from January 1, 2017.  This provision applies
 10 13 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax years beginning on
 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under
 10 16 current law to contractors, subcontractors, and builders for
 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply
 11  7 retroactively to January 1, 2015, for construction contracts
 11  8 entered into on or after that date.
 11  9    CENTRALLY ASSESSED PROPERTY.  The bill adds the department
 11 10 of revenue to the list of parties for which the director of
 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January

 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively

 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the

 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,

 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax

  9 16 tax credit applications exceed that maximum amount for a tax
  9 17 year, the bill requires the department to establish a tax
  9 18 credit wait list, and applications that were filed by the
  9 19 May 1 deadline but not approved will be placed on the wait
  9 20 list and given priority for having their application approved
  9 21 in succeeding years.  The bill states that placement on the
  9 22 wait list does not constitute a promise binding the state,
  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is

 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean
 10  3 the IRC in effect on January 1, 2016.  Under current law for
 10  4 purposes of the Iowa tax credit, IRC means that in effect on
 10  5 January 1, 2015.  This change has the effect of incorporating
 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to

 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the

 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.

 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years
 10  8 beginning in 2017 or later.  In 2015, Congress extended the
 10  9 expiration date for several of the federal energy system
 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to

 10 14 or after that date.
 10 15    SALES AND USE TAXES.  A sales tax exemption is provided under

 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends
 10 20 the definition of "designated exempt entity" to include an
 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 11  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 11  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 11  5    The sales and use tax provisions take effect upon enactment
 11  6 and apply to purchases made on or after that date, and apply

 11 11 revenue shall consider all offered evidence and witnesses
 11 12 during an appeal of an assessment of certain property centrally
 11 13 assessed by the department of revenue for purposes of property
 11 14 taxation. This provision takes effect upon enactment and
 11 15 applies retroactively to May 22, 2015.
 11 16    UTILITY REPLACEMENT TAX TASK FORCE.  The bill extends the
 11 17 utility replacement tax task force to January 1, 2019, from
 11 18 January 1, 2016.  This task force was created to study the
 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas
 11 20 providers and rate=regulated water utilities.  This provision
 11 21 takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
 11 22 January 1, 2016.
 11 23    RENEWABLE ENERGY TAX CREDIT.  The bill extends to January
 11 24 1, 2018, from January 1, 2017, the date upon which a renewable
 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January
 11 31 1, 2016, for tax years beginning on or after that date.
 11 32    For solar facilities with a generating capacity of 1.5
 11 33 megawatts or less (small solar facilities) that are owned
 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and
 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51
 12 10 percent in an eligible renewable energy facility shall not
 12 11 have an equity interest greater than 10 percent in any other
 12 12 eligible renewable energy facility.  The bill provides that
 12 13 these restrictions shall not apply to small solar facilities,
 12 14 but does provide that a specified utility shall not have an
 12 15 ownership interest in more than four small solar facilities.
 12 16 These renewable energy tax credit provisions take effect upon
 12 17 enactment and apply retroactively to January 1, 2015, for tax
 12 18 years beginning on or after that date, and apply retroactively
 12 19 to applications for the renewable energy tax credit made on or

  9 23 and the availability of a tax credit and approval of a tax
  9 24 credit application in a future year is contingent upon the
  9 25 availability of tax credits in that particular year.
  9 26    Notwithstanding the requirement under current law that
  9 27 solar energy system tax credit applications be filed by May
  9 28 1 following the year of the installation, the bill provides
  9 29 that applications filed after that deadline for solar energy
  9 30 systems installed during the 2014 or 2015 calendar years shall
  9 31 be eligible for approval.  Such applications are eligible for
  9 32 approval for the tax year during which the application is
  9 33 received, but not before tax year 2016 for installations made

 10  1 The bill also defines "Internal Revenue Code" (IRC) for
 10  2 purposes of the Iowa solar energy system tax credit to mean

 10  6 into the Iowa tax credit changes made by Congress in 2015
 10  7 to the related federal energy system credits for tax years

 10 10 tax credits upon which the Iowa tax credit is calculated
 10 11 (IRC {25D(a)(1), {25D(a)(2), and {48(a)(2)(A)(i)(II)) to

 10 17 the purchase of building materials, supplies, and equipment
 10 18 completely consumed in the performance of a construction
 10 19 contract with a designated exempt entity.  The bill amends

 10 21 instrumentality of a county or municipal government, including
 10 22 an agent of such entity, if the entity was created for the
 10 23 purpose of owning, including pursuant to a lease=purchase
 10 24 agreement, real property located within a reinvestment district
 10 25 established under the Iowa Reinvestment Act in Code chapter
 10 26 15J.  The bill also provides that the purchase of building
 10 27 materials, supplies, and equipment by such designated exempt
 10 28 entities will only be exempt from the sales tax to the extent
 10 29 such property is completely consumed in the performance of a
 10 30 construction contract to construct a project that has been
 10 31 approved by the economic development board under the Iowa
 10 32 Reinvestment Act. The Iowa Reinvestment Act, in general,
 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
 11  1 districts for use in undertaking projects within the district.
 11  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the

 11 19 effects of the replacement taxes on electricity and natural gas

 11 25 energy facility must be placed in service in order to qualify
 11 26 for the renewable energy tax credit under Code chapter 476C,
 11 27 and extends to December 31, 2027, from December 31, 2026, the
 11 28 date on which renewable energy tax credit certificates shall no
 11 29 longer be issued. These renewable energy tax credit provisions
 11 30 take effect upon enactment and apply retroactively to January

 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified
 12  3 utility must own at least 51 percent of the facility and

 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall

 11 34 or contracted for by electric cooperative associations,
 11 35 municipally owned utilities, public utilities subject to rate
 12  1 regulation, or electric cooperative associations (specified
 12  2 utilities), the bill removes the requirement that the specified

 12  4 instead provides that the specified utility must own the
 12  5 facility in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. Also
 12  6 under current law for purposes of qualifying for the tax
 12  7 credit, an owner of an eligible renewable energy facility shall
 12  8 not own more than two eligible renewable energy facilities,
 12  9 and a person that has an equity interest of at least 51

 10 33 authorizes municipalities to establish reinvestment districts
 10 34 and receive remittances of specified amounts of state sales
 10 35 tax and state hotel and motel tax revenues collected in those
