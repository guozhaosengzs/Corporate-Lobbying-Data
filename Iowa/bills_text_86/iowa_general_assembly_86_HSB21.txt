EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
relates
to
the
statute-of-repose
period
in
a
4


case
arising
out
of
the
unsafe
or
defective
condition
of
an
5


improvement
to
nonresidential
construction.
6


Under
current
law,
a
case
arising
out
of
the
unsafe
or
7


defective
condition
of
an
improvement
to
real
property,
whether
8


residential
or
nonresidential
construction,
is
subject
to
9


a
15-year
statute
of
repose.
Such
cases
are
based
upon
an
10


injury
to
property
or
an
injury
or
death
of
a
person.
The
bill
11


reduces
the
period
of
the
statute
of
repose
for
cases
relating
12


to
nonresidential
construction
from
15
years
to
10
years.
The
13


statute-of-repose
period
for
cases
relating
to
residential
14


construction
remains
15
years.
15


The
bill
defines
“residential
construction”
by
cross
16


reference
to
the
definition
of
that
term
contained
in
Code
17


chapter
572,
which
relates
to
mechanic’s
liens.
Code
section
18


572.1
defines
“residential
construction”
as
construction
on
19


single-family
or
two-family
dwellings
occupied
or
used,
or
20


intended
to
be
occupied
or
used,
primarily
for
residential
21


purposes.
The
bill
defines
“nonresidential
construction”
as
22


any
construction
that
is
not
residential
construction.
23


A
statute-of-repose
period
differs
from
a
24


statute-of-limitations
period
in
that
a
statute
of
repose
25


establishes
a
time
period
after
which
a
lawsuit
based
upon
26


negligence
in
an
improvement
to
real
property
cannot
be
filed
27


regardless
of
whether
an
injury
to
a
person
or
to
property
has
28


occurred.
A
statute-of-limitations
period
begins
at
the
date
29


of
the
injury
or
upon
discovery
of
the
deficiency.
30


The
bill
does
not
reduce
the
statute
of
repose
for
31


residential
and
nonresidential
construction
projects
in
32


existence
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
Act.
