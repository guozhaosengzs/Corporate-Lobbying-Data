  6  7    This bill relates to employers and individuals who perform
  6  8 labor and wage payment collection.
  6  9    Code section 91A.5 is amended to provide that the employer
  6 10 has the burden to establish that a deduction from employees'
  6 11 wages is lawful and that the employer must obtain written
  6 12 authorization for the deduction from the employee in advance.
  6 13    Code section 91A.6(1) is amended to remove the requirement
  6 14 that an employer be notified by the division of labor services
  6 15 of the department of workforce development before the employer
  6 16 is required to fulfill the requirements in subsection 1
  6 17 relating to employee wage and benefit information.  In new
  6 18 Code section 91A.6(1)(b), the employer is required to notify
  6 19 employees in writing whose wages are determined based on a
  6 20 task, piece, mile, or load basis about the method used to

  6 23 that an employer did not pay the minimum wage if the employer
  6 24 does not maintain proper payroll records.
  6 25    Current Code section 91A.6(2), setting out certain employer
  6 26 compliance procedures, is stricken.

  6 32 hours worked during the pay period; for an employee paid on a
  6 33 percentage of sales or revenue generated, a list of sales or
  6 34 amount of revenue during the pay period; and for an employee
  6 35 paid based on the number of miles or loads performed, the
  7  1 applicable number performed during the pay period.  An employer
  7  2 who provides an electronic statement and gives employees free
  7  3 and unrestricted access to print out the statement is in
  7  4 compliance with the Code section.
  7  5    In amended Code section 91A.8, when any specified violation
  7  6 of Code chapter 91A occurs, even if unintentional, an employer

  7 16 by employers or others, is expanded to cover persons other

  7 18 to an employee.  A 90=day period is established during which
  7 19 any action against an employee or other person is rebuttably
  7 20 presumed to be retaliatory.  New subsection 6 is created in
  7 21 Code section 91A.10 to allow the labor commissioner or any
  7 22 injured party to maintain a civil action in any court of proper
  7 23 jurisdiction.  An employer who retaliates against an employee
  7 24 or other person shall compensate the injured party an amount
  7 25 set by the labor commissioner or the court, but not less than
  7 26 $150 for each day of the violation.
  7 27    The bill creates new Code section 91A.12A to provide that
  7 28 if an employer erroneously violates the provisions of Code
  7 29 chapter 91A or the rules adopted pursuant to Code chapter
  7 30 91A, the employer shall not be subject to certain penalty
  7 31 provisions provided in Code chapter 91A if certain conditions
  7 32 are met. The first condition is that the labor commissioner
  7 33 determines that the violation was erroneous and that the
  7 34 employer attempted in good faith to comply with the provisions
  7 35 of Code chapter 91A and the rules adopted pursuant to Code
  8  1 chapter 91A.  The second condition is that the commissioner,
  8  2 after considering any history of violations by the employer,
  8  3 determines that the violation was isolated in nature. The
  8  4 third condition is that the employer corrects the violation
  8  5 to the satisfaction of the commissioner within 14 days of the
  8  6 occurrence of the violation.
  8  7    In new Code section 91A.15, an employer shall not require
  8  8 that an individual be a current employee to be paid an earned
  8  9 commission.
  8 10    The bill creates new Code section 91A.16 to stipulate that a
  8 11 provision of Code chapter 91A shall not apply to any employer
  8 12 or employee if such provision would conflict with federal law
  8 13 or regulation.
  8 14    The bill requires the labor commissioner to provide for the
  8 15 notification of each employer in Iowa of the requirements for
  8 16 employers provided in the bill by September 1, 2015. Such
  8 17 notification shall include suggested forms and procedures
  8 18 that employers may use for purposes of compliance with the
  8 19 notice and recordkeeping requirements of Code section 91A.6,
  8 20 as amended by the bill.
  8 21    An employer who violates Code chapter 91A is subject to a
  8 22 civil penalty of not more than $500 per pay period for each
  8 23 violation.

  6  7    This bill relates to employers and individuals who perform
  6  8 labor and wage payment collection.
  6  9    Code section 91A.5 is amended to provide that the employer
  6 10 has the burden to establish that a deduction from employees'

  6 15 of the department of workforce development before the employer
  6 16 is required to fulfill the requirements in subsection 1

  6 18 Code section 91A.6(1)(b), the employer is required to notify
  6 19 employees in writing whose wages are determined based on a
  6 20 task, piece, mile, or load basis about the method used to
  6 21 calculate wages and when wages are earned.  Code section
  6 22 91A.6(1)(e) is amended to establish a rebuttable presumption
  6 23 that an employer did not pay the minimum wage if the employer
  6 24 does not maintain proper payroll records.
  6 25    Current Code section 91A.6(2), setting out certain employer
  6 26 compliance procedures, is stricken.

  6 33 percentage of sales or revenue generated, a list of sales or
  6 34 amount of revenue during the pay period; and for an employee
  6 35 paid based on the number of miles or loads performed, the
  7  1 applicable number performed during the pay period.  An employer
  7  2 who provides an electronic statement and gives employees free
  7  3 and unrestricted access to print out the statement is in
  7  4 compliance with the Code section.

  7 21 Code section 91A.10 to allow the labor commissioner or any
  7 22 injured party to maintain a civil action in any court of proper
  7 23 jurisdiction.  An employer who retaliates against an employee

  6  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  7    This bill relates to employers and individuals who perform
  6  8 labor and wage payment collection.
  6  9    Code section 91A.5 is amended to provide that the employer
  6 10 has the burden to establish that a deduction from employees'
  6 11 wages is lawful and that the employer must obtain written
  6 12 authorization for the deduction from the employee in advance.
  6 13    Code section 91A.6(1) is amended to remove the requirement
  6 14 that an employer be notified by the division of labor services
  6 15 of the department of workforce development before the employer
  6 16 is required to fulfill the requirements in subsection 1
  6 17 relating to employee wage and benefit information.  In new
  6 18 Code section 91A.6(1)(b), the employer is required to notify
  6 19 employees in writing whose wages are determined based on a
  6 20 task, piece, mile, or load basis about the method used to
  6 21 calculate wages and when wages are earned.  Code section
  6 22 91A.6(1)(e) is amended to establish a rebuttable presumption
  6 23 that an employer did not pay the minimum wage if the employer
  6 24 does not maintain proper payroll records.
  6 25    Current Code section 91A.6(2), setting out certain employer
  6 26 compliance procedures, is stricken.
  6 27    Code section 91A.6(4) is amended so that the employer
  6 28 must send to each employee by mail, or at the place of
  6 29 business during the employee's working hours a statement of

  6 31 the following:  for an employee paid hourly, the number of
  6 32 hours worked during the pay period; for an employee paid on a
  6 33 percentage of sales or revenue generated, a list of sales or
  6 34 amount of revenue during the pay period; and for an employee
  6 35 paid based on the number of miles or loads performed, the
  7  1 applicable number performed during the pay period.  An employer
  7  2 who provides an electronic statement and gives employees free
  7  3 and unrestricted access to print out the statement is in
  7  4 compliance with the Code section.
  7  5    In amended Code section 91A.8, when any specified violation
  7  6 of Code chapter 91A occurs, even if unintentional, an employer

  7 16 by employers or others, is expanded to cover persons other

  7 18 to an employee.  A 90=day period is established during which
  7 19 any action against an employee or other person is rebuttably
  7 20 presumed to be retaliatory.  New subsection 6 is created in
  7 21 Code section 91A.10 to allow the labor commissioner or any
  7 22 injured party to maintain a civil action in any court of proper
  7 23 jurisdiction.  An employer who retaliates against an employee
  7 24 or other person shall compensate the injured party an amount
  7 25 set by the labor commissioner or the court, but not less than
  7 26 $150 for each day of the violation.
  7 27    The bill creates new Code section 91A.12A to provide that
  7 28 if an employer erroneously violates the provisions of Code
  7 29 chapter 91A or the rules adopted pursuant to Code chapter
  7 30 91A, the employer shall not be subject to certain penalty
  7 31 provisions provided in Code chapter 91A if certain conditions
  7 32 are met. The first condition is that the labor commissioner
  7 33 determines that the violation was erroneous and that the

  6 19 employees in writing whose wages are determined based on a
  6 20 task, piece, mile, or load basis about the method used to

  7 25 set by the labor commissioner or the court, but not less than
  7 26 $150 for each day of the violation.
  7 27    The bill creates new Code section 91A.12A to provide that
  7 28 if an employer erroneously violates the provisions of Code
  7 29 chapter 91A or the rules adopted pursuant to Code chapter
  7 30 91A, the employer shall not be subject to certain penalty
  7 31 provisions provided in Code chapter 91A if certain conditions
  7 32 are met. The first condition is that the labor commissioner

  7 34 employer attempted in good faith to comply with the provisions
  7 35 of Code chapter 91A and the rules adopted pursuant to Code
  8  1 chapter 91A.  The second condition is that the commissioner,

  8  5 to the satisfaction of the commissioner within 14 days of the
