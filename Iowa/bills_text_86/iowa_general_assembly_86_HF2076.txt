  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill modifies the sex offender registry requirements by
  4  8 requiring certain sex offenders whose registration requirements
  4  9 have expired to reregister.
  4 10    The bill creates a tier IV offense and defines a tier IV
  4 11 offense to mean any sex offense that required a sex offender to
  4 12 register under another jurisdiction's sex offender registry but
  4 13 such registration in that jurisdiction has since expired.
  4 14    The bill requires a person who has been convicted of any sex
  4 15 offense classified as a tier IV offense to register as a sex
  4 16 offender in this state as long as the person resides in this
  4 17 state.
  4 18    The bill establishes the registration requirements for a
  4 19 tier IV offender which are different from other sex offenders
  4 20 who are required to register.  Under the bill, a tier IV
  4 21 offender shall, within 30 days of establishing a residence in
  4 22 this state, appear in person to register with the sheriff of
  4 23 the county where the principal residence of the offender is
  4 24 maintained.  At the time of registration the tier IV offender
  4 25 is required to provide the sheriff with the offender's name,
  4 26 date of birth, residence, and a photograph. Current law
  4 27 provides that any new sex offender registrant must register
  4 28 with the sheriff of the county where the principal residence is
  4 29 maintained within five days of being required to do so and also
  4 30 requires a sex offender to provide more relevant information
  4 31 to the county sheriff.  The relevant information required to
  4 32 be provided to the county sheriff is listed in Code section
  4 33 692A.101(23).
  4 34    The bill does not require a tier IV offender to periodically
  4 35 verify any relevant information or to notify the county sheriff
  5  1 when certain relevant information has changed.  However,
  5  2 the bill does require a tier IV offender who establishes
  5  3 a different residence in this state to, within 30 days of
  5  4 establishing such a residence, appear in person to register
  5  5 with the sheriff of the county where the principal residence
  5  6 is maintained even if that different principal residence is
  5  7 in the same county as the previous residence and provide the
  5  8 county sheriff with the relevant information required by the
  5  9 bill including allowing the sheriff to photograph the offender.
  5 10    The bill requires a tier IV offender to pay $25 to the
  5 11 sheriff of the county of principal residence at any time when
  5 12 the offender is required to register, including when the
  5 13 offender establishes a different principal residence.  Current
  5 14 law requires a sex offender to pay a $25 annual fee to the
  5 15 county sheriff.
  5 16    A tier IV offender who violates the bill commits an
  5 17 aggravated misdemeanor for a first offense and a class "D"
  5 18 felony for any second or subsequent offense.  A tier IV
  5 19 offender is guilty of a class "C" felony if the offender
  5 20 is convicted of an aggravated offense against a minor, a
  5 21 sex offense against a minor, or a sexually violent offense

  4  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    This bill modifies the sex offender registry requirements by
  4  8 requiring certain sex offenders whose registration requirements
  4  9 have expired to reregister.
  4 10    The bill creates a tier IV offense and defines a tier IV
  4 11 offense to mean any sex offense that required a sex offender to
  4 12 register under another jurisdiction's sex offender registry but
  4 13 such registration in that jurisdiction has since expired.
  4 14    The bill requires a person who has been convicted of any sex
  4 15 offense classified as a tier IV offense to register as a sex
  4 16 offender in this state as long as the person resides in this
  4 17 state.
  4 18    The bill establishes the registration requirements for a
  4 19 tier IV offender which are different from other sex offenders
  4 20 who are required to register.  Under the bill, a tier IV
  4 21 offender shall, within 30 days of establishing a residence in
  4 22 this state, appear in person to register with the sheriff of
  4 23 the county where the principal residence of the offender is
  4 24 maintained.  At the time of registration the tier IV offender
  4 25 is required to provide the sheriff with the offender's name,
  4 26 date of birth, residence, and a photograph. Current law
  4 27 provides that any new sex offender registrant must register
  4 28 with the sheriff of the county where the principal residence is
  4 29 maintained within five days of being required to do so and also
  4 30 requires a sex offender to provide more relevant information
  4 31 to the county sheriff.  The relevant information required to
  4 32 be provided to the county sheriff is listed in Code section
  4 33 692A.101(23).
  4 34    The bill does not require a tier IV offender to periodically
  4 35 verify any relevant information or to notify the county sheriff
  5  1 when certain relevant information has changed.  However,
  5  2 the bill does require a tier IV offender who establishes
  5  3 a different residence in this state to, within 30 days of
  5  4 establishing such a residence, appear in person to register
  5  5 with the sheriff of the county where the principal residence
  5  6 is maintained even if that different principal residence is
  5  7 in the same county as the previous residence and provide the
  5  8 county sheriff with the relevant information required by the
  5  9 bill including allowing the sheriff to photograph the offender.
  5 10    The bill requires a tier IV offender to pay $25 to the
  5 11 sheriff of the county of principal residence at any time when
  5 12 the offender is required to register, including when the
  5 13 offender establishes a different principal residence.  Current
  5 14 law requires a sex offender to pay a $25 annual fee to the
  5 15 county sheriff.
  5 16    A tier IV offender who violates the bill commits an
  5 17 aggravated misdemeanor for a first offense and a class "D"
  5 18 felony for any second or subsequent offense.  A tier IV
  5 19 offender is guilty of a class "C" felony if the offender
  5 20 is convicted of an aggravated offense against a minor, a
  5 21 sex offense against a minor, or a sexually violent offense
  5 22 committed while in violation of any of the requirements
  5 23 specified in the bill.
