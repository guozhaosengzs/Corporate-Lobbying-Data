  1  3    Before the department determines whether to build a new rest
  1  4 area, the department shall conduct a thorough cost=benefit
  1  5 analysis to compare the cost of locating and constructing a
  1  6 new rest area and the cost of keeping an existing rest area
  1  7 open.  The department shall consider all available options for
  1  8 reconstructing, expanding, or otherwise improving an existing
  1  9 rest area in accordance with section 306C.21 and shall not
  1 10 proceed with construction of a new rest area unless it is
  1 11 determined that making improvements to the existing rest area
  1 12 would be cost prohibitive.

  1 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  1 18 construction of a new rest area along an interstate, freeway
  1 19 primary, or primary highway.  The department is to consider all
  1 20 available options for reconstructing, expanding, or otherwise
  1 21 improving existing rest areas and may not proceed with new
  1 22 construction unless it is determined that making improvements
  1 23 to the existing rest area would be cost prohibitive.
