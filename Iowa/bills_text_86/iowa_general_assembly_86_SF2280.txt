 13  2                           EXPLANATION
 13  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  5    This bill relates to economic development by establishing

 13 31 tourism program application review committee or the vision Iowa
 13 32 program and river enhancement community attraction and tourism
 13 33 project application review committee.
 13 34    The board is also required to include four ex officio,

 14  8 and nonvoting members, for the compensation of members for
 14  9 expenses, for the filling of vacancies on the board, and sets a
 14 10 quorum for the operation of the board. The bill requires that

 14 12 the board and makes provisions for the election of a temporary
 14 13 chairperson in case of absence or disability of the chairperson
 14 14 and vice chairperson.
 14 15    Under the bill, the board assumes responsibility for

 14 18 program and fund and oversee the community attraction and
 14 19 tourism program and community attraction and tourism fund and
 14 20 the river enhancement community attraction and tourism fund.
 14 21    The bill requires the authority to establish an enhance Iowa
 14 22 fund and provides for a contingent fiscal year appropriation of
 14 23 $25 million from the general fund of the state to the enhance
 14 24 Iowa fund. The bill provides for appropriations in that amount
 14 25 for 10 fiscal years, beginning with the 2016=2017 fiscal year.
 14 26 Under the bill, the $25 million appropriation occurs only if
 14 27 the general fund receives a transfer of over $100 million
 14 28 in that fiscal year from the Iowa economic emergency fund,
 14 29 pursuant to Code section 8.55. Moneys in the fund shall not
 14 30 revert to the general fund and interest and earnings on the
 14 31 fund are required to be credited to the fund.
 14 32    The bill requires that the authority allocate moneys in
 14 33 the fund to specified funds or for specified purposes and
 14 34 to provide an annual report to the general assembly and the
 14 35 governor. The bill provides the board with discretion to
 15  1 reallocate amounts from one purpose to other purposes, if it
 15  2 determines that demand for one purpose will not meet or exceed
 15  3 the amounts allocated for that purpose. Under the bill, the
 15  4 department of natural resources is prohibited from using moneys
 15  5 from the fund to acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands
 15  6 and waters. The bill provides for the following allocations in
 15  7 years when the fund receives an allocation:
 15  8    1. $250,000 for administration, expenses, and compensation

 15 19 allocated for improving state parks infrastructure, financing
 15 20 low head dam mitigation or removal projects, or funding

 15 31 to be funded from the $6 million allocation and the board is

 15 34    6. $12.75 million for allocation, at the discretion of the
 15 35 board, to the above=listed funds, programs, and purposes.
 16  1 The bill requires the authority to establish a sports
 16  2 tourism program, at the direction of the board. The program's
 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return
 16 28 on investment estimates for purposes of multiyear awards and
 16 29 renewal decisions. Under the bill, a bureau may apply to the
 16 30 board for financial assistance under the sports tourism program
 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill
 17 35 specifies that the authority may administer the fund as a
 18  1 revolving fund. Moneys in the fund shall not revert to the
 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same

 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill

 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill
 17 35 specifies that the authority may administer the fund as a
 18  1 revolving fund. Moneys in the fund shall not revert to the
 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans

 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill

 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.

 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill

 18  1 revolving fund. Moneys in the fund shall not revert to the
 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return
 16 28 on investment estimates for purposes of multiyear awards and
 16 29 renewal decisions. Under the bill, a bureau may apply to the
 16 30 board for financial assistance under the sports tourism program
 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill
 17 35 specifies that the authority may administer the fund as a
 18  1 revolving fund. Moneys in the fund shall not revert to the
 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions

 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,

 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under

 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that

 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting

 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.

 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return

 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill
 17 35 specifies that the authority may administer the fund as a
 18  1 revolving fund. Moneys in the fund shall not revert to the
 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill

 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill
 17 35 specifies that the authority may administer the fund as a
 18  1 revolving fund. Moneys in the fund shall not revert to the
 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return
 16 28 on investment estimates for purposes of multiyear awards and
 16 29 renewal decisions. Under the bill, a bureau may apply to the
 16 30 board for financial assistance under the sports tourism program
 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill

 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance

 14 10 quorum for the operation of the board. The bill requires that
 14 11 the governor designate a chairperson and vice chairperson of
 14 12 the board and makes provisions for the election of a temporary
 14 13 chairperson in case of absence or disability of the chairperson
 14 14 and vice chairperson.
 14 15    Under the bill, the board assumes responsibility for

 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions

 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.

 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that

 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the

 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising

 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.

 16  1 The bill requires the authority to establish a sports
 16  2 tourism program, at the direction of the board. The program's
 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill

 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that

 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill

 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.

 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be

 14 27 the general fund receives a transfer of over $100 million
 14 28 in that fiscal year from the Iowa economic emergency fund,
 14 29 pursuant to Code section 8.55. Moneys in the fund shall not
 14 30 revert to the general fund and interest and earnings on the
 14 31 fund are required to be credited to the fund.
 14 32    The bill requires that the authority allocate moneys in
 14 33 the fund to specified funds or for specified purposes and
 14 34 to provide an annual report to the general assembly and the

 15  1 reallocate amounts from one purpose to other purposes, if it
 15  2 determines that demand for one purpose will not meet or exceed
 15  3 the amounts allocated for that purpose. Under the bill, the
 15  4 department of natural resources is prohibited from using moneys
 15  5 from the fund to acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands

 16  1 The bill requires the authority to establish a sports
 16  2 tourism program, at the direction of the board. The program's
 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return
 16 28 on investment estimates for purposes of multiyear awards and

 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that

 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill

 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 14 27 the general fund receives a transfer of over $100 million
 14 28 in that fiscal year from the Iowa economic emergency fund,
 14 29 pursuant to Code section 8.55. Moneys in the fund shall not
 14 30 revert to the general fund and interest and earnings on the
 14 31 fund are required to be credited to the fund.
 14 32    The bill requires that the authority allocate moneys in
 14 33 the fund to specified funds or for specified purposes and
 14 34 to provide an annual report to the general assembly and the
 14 35 governor. The bill provides the board with discretion to
 15  1 reallocate amounts from one purpose to other purposes, if it
 15  2 determines that demand for one purpose will not meet or exceed
 15  3 the amounts allocated for that purpose. Under the bill, the
 15  4 department of natural resources is prohibited from using moneys
 15  5 from the fund to acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands
 15  6 and waters. The bill provides for the following allocations in

 15 20 low head dam mitigation or removal projects, or funding
 15 21 projects under the natural resources account in the natural
 15 22 resources and outdoor recreation trust fund. Of the $6

 16  1 The bill requires the authority to establish a sports
 16  2 tourism program, at the direction of the board. The program's
 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return
 16 28 on investment estimates for purposes of multiyear awards and
 16 29 renewal decisions. Under the bill, a bureau may apply to the
 16 30 board for financial assistance under the sports tourism program
 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill
 17 35 specifies that the authority may administer the fund as a
 18  1 revolving fund. Moneys in the fund shall not revert to the
 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 14 30 revert to the general fund and interest and earnings on the
 14 31 fund are required to be credited to the fund.
 14 32    The bill requires that the authority allocate moneys in
 14 33 the fund to specified funds or for specified purposes and
 14 34 to provide an annual report to the general assembly and the
 14 35 governor. The bill provides the board with discretion to
 15  1 reallocate amounts from one purpose to other purposes, if it
 15  2 determines that demand for one purpose will not meet or exceed
 15  3 the amounts allocated for that purpose. Under the bill, the
 15  4 department of natural resources is prohibited from using moneys
 15  5 from the fund to acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands
 15  6 and waters. The bill provides for the following allocations in
 15  7 years when the fund receives an allocation:

 15 19 allocated for improving state parks infrastructure, financing
 15 20 low head dam mitigation or removal projects, or funding
 15 21 projects under the natural resources account in the natural
 15 22 resources and outdoor recreation trust fund. Of the $6

 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill

 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that

 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.

 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.

 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be

 14 33 the fund to specified funds or for specified purposes and
 14 34 to provide an annual report to the general assembly and the

 15  1 reallocate amounts from one purpose to other purposes, if it
 15  2 determines that demand for one purpose will not meet or exceed
 15  3 the amounts allocated for that purpose. Under the bill, the
 15  4 department of natural resources is prohibited from using moneys
 15  5 from the fund to acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands
 15  6 and waters. The bill provides for the following allocations in

 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return
 16 28 on investment estimates for purposes of multiyear awards and

 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that

 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.

 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be

 15  1 reallocate amounts from one purpose to other purposes, if it
 15  2 determines that demand for one purpose will not meet or exceed
 15  3 the amounts allocated for that purpose. Under the bill, the
 15  4 department of natural resources is prohibited from using moneys
 15  5 from the fund to acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands
 15  6 and waters. The bill provides for the following allocations in

 15 29 transportation, and agriculture and land stewardship are
 15 30 required to submit applications to the board for each project
 15 31 to be funded from the $6 million allocation and the board is

 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a

 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter

 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance

 15  4 department of natural resources is prohibited from using moneys
 15  5 from the fund to acquire lands, waters, and interests in lands
 15  6 and waters. The bill provides for the following allocations in

 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same

 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans

 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising

 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects

 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.

 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.

 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance

 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the

 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans

 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board

 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in

 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting

 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.

 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,
 18 16 and provides that initial members of the enhance Iowa board be
 18 17 appointed by September 1, 2016.

 16  1 The bill requires the authority to establish a sports
 16  2 tourism program, at the direction of the board. The program's
 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return
 16 28 on investment estimates for purposes of multiyear awards and

 16 30 board for financial assistance under the sports tourism program
 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill
 17 35 specifies that the authority may administer the fund as a
 18  1 revolving fund. Moneys in the fund shall not revert to the
 18  2 general fund of the state and interest and earnings on the fund
 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.

 16 30 board for financial assistance under the sports tourism program
 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a

 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.

 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.

 16  3 purpose is to provide financial assistance for projects
 16  4 that promote sporting events for accredited colleges and
 16  5 universities and other sporting events in the state. The
 16  6 bill provides that the term "financial assistance" includes
 16  7 assistance in the form of grants, loans, and forgivable loans.
 16  8 The bill requires the authority to define the term "accredited
 16  9 colleges and universities" by rule, in consultation with the
 16 10 college student aid commission.
 16 11    The bill establishes a sports tourism program. Under the
 16 12 bill, a city, county, or public organization, including a
 16 13 convention and visitors bureau (bureau) or a regional sports
 16 14 authority district (district), may apply to the authority for
 16 15 financial assistance for a project that actively and directly
 16 16 promotes sporting events in the area served by the city,
 16 17 county, or organization. The bill specifies that a city,
 16 18 county, or organization may apply for and receive financial
 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
 16 22 year. The bill specifies that a city, county, or organization
 16 23 may apply for financial assistance for a project that spans
 16 24 multiple fiscal years or may apply for renewal of financial
 16 25 assistance awarded in a prior year. Under the bill, the board
 16 26 has the discretion as to whether to renew an award. The bill
 16 27 provides that the board may adopt certain metrics and return
 16 28 on investment estimates for purposes of multiyear awards and

 16 31 and a district, under Code section 15E.321, may apply to the
 16 32 authority for district financial assistance.
 16 33    The bill requires the board to review the applications under
 16 34 the sports tourism program and award financial assistance on a
 16 35 competitive basis. The board is required to consider project
 17  1 impacts, potential to attract Iowans and visitors, advertising
 17  2 and media coverage, investment ratios, and the quality, size,
 17  3 and scope of the project in awarding financial assistance
 17  4 under the program. The bill requires that program applicants
 17  5 demonstrate matching funds, but permits the board to waive this
 17  6 requirement.
 17  7    The bill requires that the board make final funding
 17  8 decisions on each application and allows the board to approve,
 17  9 deny, defer, or modify applications for financial assistance
 17 10 under the program. The bill allows the board and the authority
 17 11 to negotiate with applicants regarding the details of projects
 17 12 and the amount and terms of any award. The bill specifies that
 17 13 the board and the authority are exempt from Code chapter 17A in
 17 14 making final funding decisions under the program.
 17 15    Under the bill, a city, county, or organization receiving
 17 16 a sports tourism program award may use financial assistance
 17 17 received for marketing, promotions, infrastructure, and other
 17 18 purposes directly related to the promotion of the sporting
 17 19 event. The bill requires that all applications for financial
 17 20 assistance under the program be made at least 90 days prior to
 17 21 an event's scheduled date and prohibits a bureau or district
 17 22 from using financial assistance received under the program as
 17 23 reimbursement for completed projects. The bill requires that a
 17 24 city, county, or organization receiving financial assistance
 17 25 provide an annual report to the authority for years in which it
 17 26 receives financial assistance under the program and requires
 17 27 that each applicant receiving an award from the board enter
 17 28 into an agreement with the authority. The bill provides that
 17 29 such an agreement shall contain such terms and conditions
 17 30 as the board may place on the award or as the authority may
 17 31 deem necessary for the efficient administration of the sports
 17 32 tourism program.
 17 33    The bill requires the authority to establish a fund for
 17 34 the purposes of financing sports tourism projects. The bill

 18  3 are required to be credited to the fund. Moneys in the fund are
 18  4 appropriated to the authority to provide financial assistance
 18  5 to the city, county, or organization under the sports tourism
 18  6 program.
 18  7    The bill strikes Code language that provided annual fiscal
 18  8 year appropriations from the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund
 18  9 to the community attraction and tourism fund for fiscal years
 18 10 beginning on July 1, 2004, and ending on June 30, 2015.
 18 11    The bill makes conforming changes related to transitioning
 18 12 the powers and duties of the vision Iowa board to the enhance
 18 13 Iowa board. The bill also requires that the authority ensure
 18 14 the effective transition of powers and duties from the vision
 18 15 Iowa board to the enhance Iowa board in implementing the bill,

 16 19 assistance for more than one project, but a bureau shall not
 16 20 receive financial assistance under the program and financial
 16 21 assistance under the program as part of a district in the same
