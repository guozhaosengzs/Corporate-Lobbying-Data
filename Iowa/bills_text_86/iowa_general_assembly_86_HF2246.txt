 12 32 before January 1, 2017.
 12 33    Sec. 18.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to all existing

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill, entitled the "Healthy and Safe Family and
 13  5 Workplace Act", requires minimum paid sick and safe time for
 13  6 all employees employed in the state in new Code chapter 91F.
 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.

 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of

 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill, entitled the "Healthy and Safe Family and
 13  5 Workplace Act", requires minimum paid sick and safe time for
 13  6 all employees employed in the state in new Code chapter 91F.
 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.

 12 31 contract or collective bargaining agreement that was in effect
 12 32 before January 1, 2017.
 12 33    Sec. 18.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to all existing
 12 34 employees on and after January 1, 2017, and to all new
 12 35 employees hired on or after that date.
 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill, entitled the "Healthy and Safe Family and
 13  5 Workplace Act", requires minimum paid sick and safe time for
 13  6 all employees employed in the state in new Code chapter 91F.
 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.

 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of

 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in

 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the

 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their

 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or

 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an

 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon

 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill, entitled the "Healthy and Safe Family and
 13  5 Workplace Act", requires minimum paid sick and safe time for
 13  6 all employees employed in the state in new Code chapter 91F.
 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill, entitled the "Healthy and Safe Family and
 13  5 Workplace Act", requires minimum paid sick and safe time for
 13  6 all employees employed in the state in new Code chapter 91F.
 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective

 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill, entitled the "Healthy and Safe Family and
 13  5 Workplace Act", requires minimum paid sick and safe time for
 13  6 all employees employed in the state in new Code chapter 91F.
 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,

 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill, entitled the "Healthy and Safe Family and
 13  5 Workplace Act", requires minimum paid sick and safe time for
 13  6 all employees employed in the state in new Code chapter 91F.
 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill, entitled the "Healthy and Safe Family and
 13  5 Workplace Act", requires minimum paid sick and safe time for
 13  6 all employees employed in the state in new Code chapter 91F.
 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.

 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one

 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,

 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and

 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.

 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe

 13  7  The bill declares public policy of the state pertaining to the
 13  8 bill.
 13  9    The bill defines "sick and safe time" as time that is
 13 10 compensated at the same hourly rate and with the same benefits,
 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective

 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.

 13 11 including health care benefits, as the employee normally
 13 12 earns during hours worked and is provided by an employer to
 13 13 an employee for the purposes described in the bill. The bill
 13 14 defines additional terms including "employee", "employer", and
 13 15 "family member".
 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil

 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.

 13 16    The bill provides that all employees shall have the right to
 13 17 accrue and use sick and safe time. The formula for accruing
 13 18 sick and safe time is contained in the bill, and there are
 13 19 limits for the amount of sick and safe time an employee may
 13 20 accrue per year, unless the employer sets a higher limit.
 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked

 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other

 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,

 13 21    The formula for accruing sick and safe time and the
 13 22 limitations and exceptions are provided in new Code section
 13 23 91F.4. Sick and safe time shall begin to accrue for new
 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when

 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are

 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If

 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the

 13 24 employees hired on or after January 1, 2017, on the first
 13 25 day of work and for existing employees on January 1, 2017.
 13 26 Employees may use accrued sick and safe time starting the 30th
 13 27 day of employment. Sick and safe time shall carry over one
 13 28 year, but an employee shall not accrue more than 83 hours of
 13 29 sick and safe time per year.
 13 30    An employer who provides a leave policy that meets the
 13 31 minimum accrual requirements and the same minimum uses and
 13 32 conditions is deemed to be in compliance with the bill. The
 13 33 bill does not require employees to be reimbursed for unused
 13 34 sick and safe time upon separation from employment. However,
 13 35 if an employee is moved or transferred within the company, the
 14  1 employee shall retain and may use all accrued sick and safe
 14  2 time. If there is an employment separation, but an employee
 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon

 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an

 14  3 is rehired within six months, all accrued sick and safe time
 14  4 shall be reinstated upon rehire and be available for immediate
 14  5 use. An employer has the discretion to advance sick and safe
 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,

 14  6 time to an employee.
 14  7    The bill provides specific reasons for which employees may
 14  8 use the sick and safe time in new Code section 91F.5. An
 14  9 employee shall give reasonable notice to an employer when
 14 10 use of sick and safe time is foreseeable and shall make a
 14 11 reasonable effort to schedule the use of sick and safe time in
 14 12 a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the
 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other

 14 13 employer. When an employee uses more than three consecutive
 14 14 days of sick and safe time, an employer may require reasonable
 14 15 documentation that the time used is covered as provided in
 14 16 the bill. If an employer chooses to require documentation
 14 17 from an employee for use of sick and safe time, the employer
 14 18 is responsible for paying any costs charged to the employee
 14 19 by a health care provider or other entity for providing the
 14 20 specific documentation required by the employer.  If the
 14 21 employee has health insurance that covers any portion of the
 14 22 costs of obtaining such documentation, the employer shall only
 14 23 be responsible for paying costs that are not covered by the
 14 24 employee's health insurance. An employer shall not require an
 14 25 employee to find a replacement worker in order to use sick and
 14 26 safe time.
 14 27    An employee's rights under the bill, including the right
 14 28 to use sick and safe time and to file a complaint against
 14 29 an employer, and the prohibitions against an employer's
 14 30 retaliation against an employee exercising those rights, are
 14 31 explained in new Code section 91F.6.
 14 32    Employers are required to give employees notice of their
 14 33 rights to sick and safe time as described in new Code section
 14 34 91F.7, either by supplying each employee with a notice or
 14 35 by posting such notice in an accessible and obvious place
 15  1 where employees work. Violations of the notice and posting
 15  2 requirements may result in a civil penalty of not more than
 15  3 $100 for each offense.
 15  4    An employee may recover the monetary value of owed sick
 15  5 and safe time plus liquidated damages for the wrongful denial
 15  6 of use of accrued sick and safe time if an employer is shown
 15  7 to have intentionally violated the bill pursuant to new Code
 15  8 section 91F.8.
 15  9    An employer must retain records documenting hours worked
 15 10 by each employee and the amount of leave, including sick and
 15 11 safe time, taken by employees for five years. The labor
 15 12 commissioner shall have reasonable access to these records. If
 15 13 a question arises about an employee's right to sick and safe
 15 14 time and an employer does not have adequate records or does not
 15 15 allow the commissioner to examine the employer's records, the
 15 16 commissioner shall presume that the employer has violated the
 15 17 bill.
 15 18    Pursuant to new Code section 91F.10, an employee may submit
 15 19 a written complaint to the commissioner, who will determine
 15 20 whether to investigate the claim that an employer has violated
 15 21 any provision of new Code chapter 91F.  If the commissioner
 15 22 decides to investigate, the commissioner shall commence a civil
 15 23 action against the employer.
 15 24    An employer shall not require an employee to disclose
 15 25 details relating to domestic abuse, sexual abuse, stalking,
 15 26 murder, or a medical condition as a condition of using sick and
 15 27 safe time. An employer who has such information shall treat
 15 28 the information as confidential and not disclose it without
 15 29 written consent of the affected employee, according to new Code
 15 30 section 91F.11.
 15 31    The bill provides that the new Code chapter does not prohibit
 15 32 an employer from providing a more generous sick and safe
 15 33 time policy than required by the bill, does not diminish an
 15 34 employer's previous contractual obligations for more generous
 15 35 sick and safe time, and does not diminish public employees'
 16  1 other rights to sick and safe time as provided by law.
 16  2    The commissioner is required to create a poster and other
 16  3 informational materials which an employer may use for public
 16  4 display.  The poster and other informational materials must
 16  5 comply with the notice requirements for sick and safe time
 16  6 provided in the bill.  The commissioner is to make the poster
 16  7 and other informational materials available to an employer upon
 16  8 verification of compliance with the bill.
 16  9    The bill applies to all existing employees on and after
 16 10 January 1, 2017, and to all new hires on or after that date,
 16 11 but does not apply to employees under contracts or collective
 16 12 bargaining agreements in effect before January 1, 2017.
