  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    This bill provides for the issuance of a temporary
  3  6 restricted employment license that only allows a person
  3  7 to drive to and from the person's home and the location
  3  8 or locations of the person's full=time or part=time
  3  9 employment. The license may be issued where the department
  3 10 of transportation has denied the person's application for a
  3 11 temporary restricted license under Code section 321.215 or the
  3 12 person is not eligible for a temporary restricted license under
  3 13 Code section 321.215.
  3 14    The bill provides that to be eligible for the temporary
  3 15 restricted employment license, a person must be employed
  3 16 full=time or part=time, an alternative means of transportation
  3 17 must not exist to the location or locations of the person's
  3 18 employment, the person must have proof of financial
  3 19 responsibility, and in order to pay the fines related to
  3 20 the violation or violations resulting in the suspension
  3 21 or revocation of the person's driver's license, the person
  3 22 must have entered into a payment plan with the centralized
  3 23 collection unit of the department of revenue, the county
  3 24 attorney, or the county attorney's designee. In addition, a
  3 25 person is only eligible for the temporary restricted employment
  3 26 license if the person's driver's license was suspended or
  3 27 revoked for violations related to driving with a suspended or
  3 28 revoked driver's license, possession of marijuana in small
  3 29 amounts, nonpayment of fines, drag racing, reckless driving,
  3 30 out=of=state violations, or various other violations that
  3 31 may result in administrative suspension by the department of
  3 32 transportation.
  3 33    The temporary restricted employment license shall expire
  3 34 six months after the date of issuance, but shall be renewable
  3 35 if the person remains current with the payment plan entered
  4  1 into with the centralized collection unit of the department
  4  2 of revenue, the county attorney, or the county attorney's
  4  3 designee. The temporary restricted employment license shall
  4  4 be canceled upon conviction of a moving traffic violation or
  4  5 upon a violation of a term of the license, but not for a parking
  4  6 violation. The temporary restricted employment license is not
  4  7 valid to operate a commercial motor vehicle if a commercial
  4  8 driver's license is required for the person's operation of the
  4  9 commercial motor vehicle.
