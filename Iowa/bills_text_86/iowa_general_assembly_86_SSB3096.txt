who
pay
membership
dues
to
19


certain
local,
regional,

2


The
bill
amends
Code
section
282.8
to
establish
that
the
3


tuition
fee
for
students
not
requiring
special
education
shall

not

districts.
The
bill
also
provides
that
if
the
tuition
fee
for
12


the
school
district
in
the
adjoining
state
is
a
variable
rate,
13


the
test
of
which
tuition
fee
is
lower
shall
be
determined
for
14


each
student
by
the
affected
boards.
For
students
requiring
15


special
education,
the
bill
provides
that
the
tuition
fee
16


shall
be
equal
to
the
actual
cost
of
the
special

17


instructional
program
provided
to

If
there
is
no

between
districts
or
the
agreement
20


has
expired
or
been
terminated,
or
if
the
distance
requirements

are
not
met,
the

provides
that
a
student
attending
school

in

shall
be
treated
as
a
nonresident

23


purposes
of

payments
to
the
receiving
district
or
24


for
purposes
of
establishing
enrollment
for
purposes
of
the
25


school
aid
formula.
The
bill
further
establishes
that
an
26


agreement
reached
under
Code
section
282.8
does
not
qualify
as
27


a
whole

and,
also,
the
open

of
Code

WHOLE
GRADE
SHARING
AGREEMENTS.
Whole
grade
sharing
1


is
a
procedure
used
by
school
districts
in
which
all
or
a
2


substantial
portion
of
the
pupils
in
any
grade
in
two
or
3


more
school
districts
share
an
educational
program
for
all
4


or
a
substantial
portion
of
a
school
day
under
a
written
5


agreement.
Currently,
the
boards
of
the
school
districts
6


participating
in
the
agreement
must
negotiate,
as
part
of
7


the
new
or
existing
agreement,
the
disposition
of
funding
8


provided
under
Code
chapter
284,
the
student
achievement

teacher
leadership
supplemental
aid
payments,
unless
all
15


districts
subject
to
the
agreement
are
receiving
such

16


Because
the
funding
for
the
teacher
leadership
supplemental
aid
17


payments
is
scheduled
to
end
with
the
2016-2017
fiscal
year,
18


the
bill
repeals
the
relevant
provision
June
30,
2018.

The

OPEN
ENROLLMENT
PAYMENTS.
In

REPEALS.
The
bill
repeals
the
following:
3


1.
PILOT
PROJECTS
TO
IMPROVE
INSTRUCTIONAL
PROGRAMS.
When
4


first
enacted
in
1987,
the
provision
was
part
of
a
program
5


to
offer
incentives
to
school
districts
that
established
6


pilot
projects
to
utilize
a
modified
block
schedule
for
7


offering
classes
in
the
districts
and
sharing
the
certificated
8


instructional
personnel.
Implementation
by
the
department
9


of
education
is
dependent
on
whether
the
general
assembly
10


appropriates
funding
for
the
pilot
projects.
11


2.
TEACHER
EXCHANGE
PROGRAM.
The
teacher
exchange
program
12


was
enacted
in
1991,
contingent
on
an
appropriation
of
moneys
13


by
the
general
assembly,
to
permit
school
districts
to
exchange
14


licensed
instructional
personnel
with
other
districts
in
order
15


to
promote
the
exchange
and
enhancement
of
instructional
16


methods
and
materials
and
encourage
the
educational
development
17


of
Iowa’s
teachers.
