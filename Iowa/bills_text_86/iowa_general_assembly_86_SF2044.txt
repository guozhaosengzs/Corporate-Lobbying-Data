  1  1    Section 1.  FINDINGS.  The general assembly finds all of the
  1  2 following:
  1  3    1.  Private nonprofit educational institutions play a vital
  1  4 role in providing formal education in society, and the United
  1  5 States and Iowa support and recognize these institutions in
  1  6 part by providing important and necessary tax benefits.
  1  7    2.  The United States and Iowa have a long, honorable history
  1  8 of accommodating religious exercise and establishing conscience
  1  9 protections based on religious and moral convictions.
  1 10    3.  Protecting the tax benefits available to private
  1 11 nonprofit educational institutions from being denied based
  1 12 on religious or moral convictions is a state interest of the
  1 13 highest order.  The state is obligated to take measures that
  1 14 advance this interest by remedying, deterring, and preventing
  1 15 government interference with religious exercise in a way that
  1 16 complements the protections mandated by the Constitution of the
  1 17 State of Iowa and the Constitution of the United States.
  1 18    4.  In 2015, during the course of oral argument at the United
  1 19 States Supreme Court, in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct.
  1 20 2584 (2015), when Justice Alito asked whether an institution
  1 21 could lose its tax=exempt status for maintaining the view that
  1 22 marriage is the union of one man and one woman, the solicitor
  1 23 general of the United States admitted it was "going to be an
  1 24 issue".
  1 25    5.  In the Obergefell v. Hodges opinion, the United States
  1 26 Supreme Court held same=sex couples have a right to marry, but
  1 27 also noted, "Many who deem same=sex marriage to be wrong reach
  1 28 that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or
  1 29 philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are
  1 30 disparaged here".
  1 31    6.  In the wake of the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, leading
  1 32 legal scholars concur that conflict between same=sex marriage
  1 33 and religious liberty are inevitable and, therefore, should be
  1 34 addressed through legislation.
  1 35    7.  The state of Iowa has an obligation to refrain from
  2  1 discriminating against those who maintain a belief that
  2  2 marriage is the union of one man and one woman based on
  2  3 religious and moral convictions.
  2  4    8.  Laws that protect important and necessary tax benefits
  2  5 from being denied because of the free exercise of religious
  2  6 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage will encourage
  2  7 private citizens and institutions to demonstrate tolerance for
  2  8 those beliefs and convictions and therefore contribute to a
  2  9 more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.

  1  4 role in providing formal education in society, and the United
  1  5 States and Iowa support and recognize these institutions in
  1  6 part by providing important and necessary tax benefits.
  1  7    2.  The United States and Iowa have a long, honorable history
  1  8 of accommodating religious exercise and establishing conscience
  1  9 protections based on religious and moral convictions.
  1 10    3.  Protecting the tax benefits available to private
  1 11 nonprofit educational institutions from being denied based
  1 12 on religious or moral convictions is a state interest of the
  1 13 highest order.  The state is obligated to take measures that
  1 14 advance this interest by remedying, deterring, and preventing
  1 15 government interference with religious exercise in a way that
  1 16 complements the protections mandated by the Constitution of the
  1 17 State of Iowa and the Constitution of the United States.
  1 18    4.  In 2015, during the course of oral argument at the United
  1 19 States Supreme Court, in Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct.
  1 20 2584 (2015), when Justice Alito asked whether an institution
  1 21 could lose its tax=exempt status for maintaining the view that
  1 22 marriage is the union of one man and one woman, the solicitor
  1 23 general of the United States admitted it was "going to be an
  1 24 issue".
  1 25    5.  In the Obergefell v. Hodges opinion, the United States
  1 26 Supreme Court held same=sex couples have a right to marry, but
  1 27 also noted, "Many who deem same=sex marriage to be wrong reach
  1 28 that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or
  1 29 philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are
  1 30 disparaged here".
  1 31    6.  In the wake of the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, leading
  1 32 legal scholars concur that conflict between same=sex marriage
  1 33 and religious liberty are inevitable and, therefore, should be
  1 34 addressed through legislation.
  1 35    7.  The state of Iowa has an obligation to refrain from
  2  1 discriminating against those who maintain a belief that
  2  2 marriage is the union of one man and one woman based on
  2  3 religious and moral convictions.
  2  4    8.  Laws that protect important and necessary tax benefits
  2  5 from being denied because of the free exercise of religious
  2  6 beliefs and moral convictions about marriage will encourage
  2  7 private citizens and institutions to demonstrate tolerance for
  2  8 those beliefs and convictions and therefore contribute to a
  2  9 more respectful, diverse, and peaceful society.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.

  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit

  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings

  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a

  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to

  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the

  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the

  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United

  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.

  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes

  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of

  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.

  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of

  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to

  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several

  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of

  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to

  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available

  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the

  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.
  7  5    The provisions of the bill are severable.  The bill takes
  7  6 effect upon enactment.

  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings

  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.

  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic
  6  9 preservation and cultural and entertainment district tax
  6 10 credit, the school tuition organization tax credit, the
  6 11 charitable conservation contribution tax credit, the tuition
  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection
  6 28 of free exercise of religious beliefs and moral convictions,
  6 29 to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of the bill and
  6 30 the Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United
  6 31 States.  The protection of free exercise of religious beliefs
  6 32 and moral convictions afforded by the bill are in addition to
  6 33 the protections provided under federal law, state law, and the
  6 34 Constitutions of the State of Iowa and of the United States,
  6 35 and the bill is not to be construed to preempt or repeal any
  7  1 state or local law that is equally or more protective of free
  7  2 exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions or to narrow
  7  3 the meaning or application of any state or local law protecting
  7  4 free exercise of religious beliefs or moral convictions.

  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings

  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.

  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax

  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax

  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.

  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
  6 27    The bill is to be construed in favor of a broad protection

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill protects tax benefits of private nonprofit
  5 15 educational institutions from being disallowed because of
  5 16 certain religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The bill also
  5 17 makes several findings, including but not limited to findings
  5 18 related to the state interest in protecting tax benefits of
  5 19 private nonprofit educational institutions, and in protecting
  5 20 and promoting the free exercise of religious beliefs and moral
  5 21 convictions about marriage.
  5 22    The bill provides that notwithstanding any other provision
  5 23 of state law to the contrary, if a tax benefit is available
  5 24 under Iowa law that applies to, or is dependent upon, a private
  5 25 educational institution that is recognized as nonprofit, or
  5 26 exempt from federal taxation under Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
  5 27 {501(a), such tax benefit shall not be disallowed on or after
  5 28 the effective date of the bill because the private educational
  5 29 institution believes, acts, or teaches in accordance with a
  5 30 religious belief or moral conviction that marriage is or should
  5 31 be recognized as the union of one man and one woman, or that
  5 32 sexual relations are properly reserved to such marriage, or
  5 33 because the private educational institution was disallowed a
  5 34 tax exemption under IRC {501(a) on the basis of those beliefs,
  5 35 acts, or teachings.  "Private educational institution" and "tax
  6  1 benefit" are both defined in the bill.
  6  2    The bill provides a nonexhaustive list of tax benefits to
  6  3 which the protection from disallowance applies and in certain
  6  4 cases provides for how those tax benefits shall be administered
  6  5 when the protection from disallowance becomes applicable.
  6  6    The nonexhaustive list includes the redevelopment tax
  6  7 credits, the workforce housing tax incentives, several
  6  8 exemptions from the fee for new registration, the historic

  6 12 tax credit, the exemption from the corporate income tax,
  6 13 several sales tax exemptions and refunds, several property tax
  6 14 exemptions, the charitable contribution deductions under the
  6 15 individual and corporate income tax and franchise tax, and the
  6 16 charitable contribution exemption under the inheritance tax.
  6 17 With regard to charitable contributions, the bill provides
  6 18 that contributions or bequests that would have qualified as
  6 19 tax=deductible charitable contributions under the IRC but for
  6 20 the fact that the private educational institution that was the
  6 21 recipient or beneficiary of the property was disallowed a tax
  6 22 exemption under IRC {501(a) for believing, acting, or teaching
  6 23 in a way described in the bill, shall be considered deductible
  6 24 contributions under the individual and corporate income tax
  6 25 and franchise tax, and shall be considered exempt under the
  6 26 inheritance tax.
