 20 10                           EXPLANATION
 20 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 20 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 20 13    GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal Agriculture
 20 14 Compliance Act for Open Feedlot Operations" (Code chapter 459A)
 20 15 which authorizes the department of natural resources (DNR)
 20 16 to regulate open feedlot operations.  Generally, the bill
 20 17 provides for the regulation of an animal truck wash facility
 20 18 (facility) which engages in washing certain trucks transporting
 20 19 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys,
 20 20 or fish) and collecting and storing the resulting animal
 20 21 effluent in an animal truck wash effluent basin (basin).  The
 20 22 bill's provisions regulating such facilities and the resulting
 20 23 effluent are closely related to the regulation of settled open
 20 24 feedlot effluent basins which are impoundments used to collect
 20 25 and store effluent, including solids, and the application of
 20 26 effluent from those operations.
 20 27    DOCUMENTS.  The bill requires the owner of a facility
 20 28 to submit a number of different documents for departmental
 20 29 approval, including an application for a permit and associated
 20 30 statements required to construct a basin.   These include a
 20 31 nutrient management plan that addresses restrictions on the
 20 32 land application of effluent; a soils and hydrogeologic report;
 20 33 and a construction certification authenticated by a licensed
 20 34 professional engineer (Code sections 459A.102, 459A.205, and
 20 35 459A.206).
 21  1 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.  The  bill establishes construction
 21  2 design standards for basins, requires separation distances
 21  3 between a basin and certain locations or objects, including
 21  4 residences, commercial enterprises, bona fide religious
 21  5 institutions, educational institutions, public use areas,
 21  6 public thoroughfares, surface intakes of agricultural drainage
 21  7 wells, wellheads, cisterns of agricultural drainage wells,
 21  8 known sinkholes, lakes, rivers, reservoirs, creeks, streams,
 21  9 ditches, and wells.  The bill restricts basins from being
 21 10 constructed on karst terrain based on requirements in Code
 21 11 chapter 459 regulating confinement feeding operations (Code
 21 12 section 459A.404). The bill also requires special provisions
 21 13 for tile lines, and restricts construction within a distance
 21 14 from bedrock and on floodplains (Code section 459A.302).
 21 15    OPERATING PERMITS FOR OPEN FEEDLOTS.  The bill eliminates
 21 16 a provision requiring an open feedlot to operate pursuant to
 21 17 an operating permit issued by the department (Code section
 21 18 459A.401) so long as the operation obtains a so=called
 21 19 NPDES permit under the federal national pollutant discharge
 21 20 elimination system program.
 21 21    STOCKPILING AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.  The bill places
 21 22 restrictions upon the stockpiling of solids from effluent (Code
 21 23 section 459A.403) and the land application of effluent.  Such
 21 24 application cannot cause surface water or groundwater pollution
 21 25 (Code section 459A.410).  The bill requires the department to
 21 26 establish requirements for application of effluent including by
 21 27 establishing separation distances required between the site of
 21 28 application and locations and objects identified by the rules.
 21 29    DISCONTINUANCE.  The owner of a facility must remove
 21 30 effluent after the operation of the facility is discontinued
 21 31 (Code section 459A.411).
 21 32    ENFORCEMENT.  DNR and the attorney general are responsible
 21 33 for enforcing the provisions of the bill (Code section
 21 34 459A.501).
 21 35    PENALTIES.  A person who is in violation of the
 22  1 prohibition would be subject to a civil penalty, that may be
 22  2 administratively assessed by the department, in an amount of
 22  3 not more than $10,000 (Code sections 459A.502 and 455B.109), or
 22  4 judicially assessed for an amount not more than $5,000 per each
 22  5 day of the violation (Code sections 459A.502 and 455B.191).
 22  6 Collected moneys would be deposited into the watershed
 22  7 improvement fund (Code sections 459A.502 and 466A.2).

 20 13    GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal Agriculture
 20 14 Compliance Act for Open Feedlot Operations" (Code chapter 459A)
 20 15 which authorizes the department of natural resources (DNR)
 20 16 to regulate open feedlot operations.  Generally, the bill
 20 17 provides for the regulation of an animal truck wash facility
 20 18 (facility) which engages in washing certain trucks transporting
 20 19 animals (cattle, swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys,
 20 20 or fish) and collecting and storing the resulting animal
 20 21 effluent in an animal truck wash effluent basin (basin).  The
 20 22 bill's provisions regulating such facilities and the resulting
 20 23 effluent are closely related to the regulation of settled open
 20 24 feedlot effluent basins which are impoundments used to collect
 20 25 and store effluent, including solids, and the application of
 20 26 effluent from those operations.
 20 27    DOCUMENTS.  The bill requires the owner of a facility
 20 28 to submit a number of different documents for departmental
 20 29 approval, including an application for a permit and associated
 20 30 statements required to construct a basin.   These include a
 20 31 nutrient management plan that addresses restrictions on the
 20 32 land application of effluent; a soils and hydrogeologic report;
 20 33 and a construction certification authenticated by a licensed
 20 34 professional engineer (Code sections 459A.102, 459A.205, and
 20 35 459A.206).
 21  1 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.  The  bill establishes construction
 21  2 design standards for basins, requires separation distances
 21  3 between a basin and certain locations or objects, including
 21  4 residences, commercial enterprises, bona fide religious
 21  5 institutions, educational institutions, public use areas,
 21  6 public thoroughfares, surface intakes of agricultural drainage
 21  7 wells, wellheads, cisterns of agricultural drainage wells,
 21  8 known sinkholes, lakes, rivers, reservoirs, creeks, streams,
 21  9 ditches, and wells.  The bill restricts basins from being
 21 10 constructed on karst terrain based on requirements in Code
 21 11 chapter 459 regulating confinement feeding operations (Code
 21 12 section 459A.404). The bill also requires special provisions
 21 13 for tile lines, and restricts construction within a distance
 21 14 from bedrock and on floodplains (Code section 459A.302).
 21 15    OPERATING PERMITS FOR OPEN FEEDLOTS.  The bill eliminates
 21 16 a provision requiring an open feedlot to operate pursuant to
 21 17 an operating permit issued by the department (Code section
 21 18 459A.401) so long as the operation obtains a so=called
 21 19 NPDES permit under the federal national pollutant discharge
 21 20 elimination system program.
 21 21    STOCKPILING AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.  The bill places
 21 22 restrictions upon the stockpiling of solids from effluent (Code
 21 23 section 459A.403) and the land application of effluent.  Such
 21 24 application cannot cause surface water or groundwater pollution
 21 25 (Code section 459A.410).  The bill requires the department to
 21 26 establish requirements for application of effluent including by
 21 27 establishing separation distances required between the site of
 21 28 application and locations and objects identified by the rules.
 21 29    DISCONTINUANCE.  The owner of a facility must remove
 21 30 effluent after the operation of the facility is discontinued
 21 31 (Code section 459A.411).
 21 32    ENFORCEMENT.  DNR and the attorney general are responsible
 21 33 for enforcing the provisions of the bill (Code section
 21 34 459A.501).
 21 35    PENALTIES.  A person who is in violation of the
 22  1 prohibition would be subject to a civil penalty, that may be
 22  2 administratively assessed by the department, in an amount of
 22  3 not more than $10,000 (Code sections 459A.502 and 455B.109), or
 22  4 judicially assessed for an amount not more than $5,000 per each
 22  5 day of the violation (Code sections 459A.502 and 455B.191).
 22  6 Collected moneys would be deposited into the watershed

 20 24 feedlot effluent basins which are impoundments used to collect
 20 25 and store effluent, including solids, and the application of
 20 26 effluent from those operations.
 20 27    DOCUMENTS.  The bill requires the owner of a facility
 20 28 to submit a number of different documents for departmental
 20 29 approval, including an application for a permit and associated
 20 30 statements required to construct a basin.   These include a
 20 31 nutrient management plan that addresses restrictions on the
 20 32 land application of effluent; a soils and hydrogeologic report;
 20 33 and a construction certification authenticated by a licensed
 20 34 professional engineer (Code sections 459A.102, 459A.205, and
 20 35 459A.206).
 21  1 CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.  The  bill establishes construction
 21  2 design standards for basins, requires separation distances
 21  3 between a basin and certain locations or objects, including
 21  4 residences, commercial enterprises, bona fide religious
 21  5 institutions, educational institutions, public use areas,
 21  6 public thoroughfares, surface intakes of agricultural drainage
 21  7 wells, wellheads, cisterns of agricultural drainage wells,
 21  8 known sinkholes, lakes, rivers, reservoirs, creeks, streams,
 21  9 ditches, and wells.  The bill restricts basins from being
 21 10 constructed on karst terrain based on requirements in Code
 21 11 chapter 459 regulating confinement feeding operations (Code
 21 12 section 459A.404). The bill also requires special provisions
 21 13 for tile lines, and restricts construction within a distance
 21 14 from bedrock and on floodplains (Code section 459A.302).
 21 15    OPERATING PERMITS FOR OPEN FEEDLOTS.  The bill eliminates
 21 16 a provision requiring an open feedlot to operate pursuant to
 21 17 an operating permit issued by the department (Code section

 21 19 NPDES permit under the federal national pollutant discharge
 21 20 elimination system program.
 21 21    STOCKPILING AND APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.  The bill places
 21 22 restrictions upon the stockpiling of solids from effluent (Code
 21 23 section 459A.403) and the land application of effluent.  Such
 21 24 application cannot cause surface water or groundwater pollution
 21 25 (Code section 459A.410).  The bill requires the department to
 21 26 establish requirements for application of effluent including by
 21 27 establishing separation distances required between the site of
 21 28 application and locations and objects identified by the rules.
 21 29    DISCONTINUANCE.  The owner of a facility must remove
 21 30 effluent after the operation of the facility is discontinued
 21 31 (Code section 459A.411).
 21 32    ENFORCEMENT.  DNR and the attorney general are responsible
 21 33 for enforcing the provisions of the bill (Code section
 21 34 459A.501).
 21 35    PENALTIES.  A person who is in violation of the
 22  1 prohibition would be subject to a civil penalty, that may be
 22  2 administratively assessed by the department, in an amount of
 22  3 not more than $10,000 (Code sections 459A.502 and 455B.109), or
 22  4 judicially assessed for an amount not more than $5,000 per each
 22  5 day of the violation (Code sections 459A.502 and 455B.191).
