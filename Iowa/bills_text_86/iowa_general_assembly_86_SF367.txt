  5  2                           EXPLANATION
  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill modifies the types of endowment gifts that
  5  6 qualify for the endow Iowa tax credit.  Under current law,
  5  7 the endow Iowa tax credit is available for 25 percent of a
  5  8 taxpayer's endowment gift to an endow Iowa qualified community
  5  9 foundation for a permanent endowment fund established to
  5 10 benefit a charitable cause in this state.  The bill allows
  5 11 the tax credit for 25 percent of a taxpayer's endowment gift
  5 12 to an endow Iowa scholarship fund.  In order to be an endow
  5 13 Iowa scholarship fund and qualify for the tax credit, a fund
  5 14 must meet several requirements.  First, the fund must be a
  5 15 permanent endowment fund.  Second, the fund must be established
  5 16 and held by a qualified postsecondary educational institution
  5 17 or a nonprofit, tax=exempt entity acting solely for the
  5 18 support of a qualified postsecondary educational institution.
  5 19 "Qualified postsecondary educational institution" means an Iowa
  5 20 community college or a nonprofit accredited private institution
  5 21 in this state that meets certain requirements specified
  5 22 in the bill.  Third, the fund must be established and used
  5 23 exclusively to provide scholarships or tuition grants to Iowa
  5 24 residents attending the qualified postsecondary educational
  5 25 institution.  Fourth, the scholarships and tuition grants must
  5 26 be paid exclusively from the earnings of the fund and must not
  5 27 exceed five percent of the fund assets per year.  The entity
  5 28 establishing the endow Iowa scholarship fund must register the
  5 29 fund with the economic development authority (EDA), and the EDA
  5 30 shall not register more than one endow Iowa scholarship fund
  5 31 per qualified postsecondary educational institution.
  5 32    In addition to the $6 million that may be authorized per
  5 33 calendar year under current law for endowment gifts to endow
  5 34 Iowa qualified community foundations, the bill provides that
  5 35 up to $3 million in tax credits may be authorized per year
  6  1 for endowment gifts to endow Iowa scholarship funds.  Of that
  6  2 $3 million, not more than 2.5 percent ($75,000) shall be
  6  3 granted to any one taxpayer, and 10 percent ($300,000) shall be

  5  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  5    This bill modifies the types of endowment gifts that
  5  6 qualify for the endow Iowa tax credit.  Under current law,
  5  7 the endow Iowa tax credit is available for 25 percent of a
  5  8 taxpayer's endowment gift to an endow Iowa qualified community
  5  9 foundation for a permanent endowment fund established to
  5 10 benefit a charitable cause in this state.  The bill allows
  5 11 the tax credit for 25 percent of a taxpayer's endowment gift
  5 12 to an endow Iowa scholarship fund.  In order to be an endow
  5 13 Iowa scholarship fund and qualify for the tax credit, a fund
  5 14 must meet several requirements.  First, the fund must be a
  5 15 permanent endowment fund.  Second, the fund must be established
  5 16 and held by a qualified postsecondary educational institution
  5 17 or a nonprofit, tax=exempt entity acting solely for the
  5 18 support of a qualified postsecondary educational institution.
  5 19 "Qualified postsecondary educational institution" means an Iowa
  5 20 community college or a nonprofit accredited private institution
  5 21 in this state that meets certain requirements specified
  5 22 in the bill.  Third, the fund must be established and used
  5 23 exclusively to provide scholarships or tuition grants to Iowa
  5 24 residents attending the qualified postsecondary educational
  5 25 institution.  Fourth, the scholarships and tuition grants must
  5 26 be paid exclusively from the earnings of the fund and must not
  5 27 exceed five percent of the fund assets per year.  The entity
  5 28 establishing the endow Iowa scholarship fund must register the
  5 29 fund with the economic development authority (EDA), and the EDA
  5 30 shall not register more than one endow Iowa scholarship fund
  5 31 per qualified postsecondary educational institution.
  5 32    In addition to the $6 million that may be authorized per
  5 33 calendar year under current law for endowment gifts to endow
  5 34 Iowa qualified community foundations, the bill provides that
  5 35 up to $3 million in tax credits may be authorized per year
  6  1 for endowment gifts to endow Iowa scholarship funds.  Of that
  6  2 $3 million, not more than 2.5 percent ($75,000) shall be
  6  3 granted to any one taxpayer, and 10 percent ($300,000) shall be
  6  4 reserved for endowment gifts in amounts of $30,000 or less.  If

  5 10 benefit a charitable cause in this state.  The bill allows

  5 14 must meet several requirements.  First, the fund must be a
  5 15 permanent endowment fund.  Second, the fund must be established
  5 16 and held by a qualified postsecondary educational institution
  5 17 or a nonprofit, tax=exempt entity acting solely for the

  5 22 in the bill.  Third, the fund must be established and used
  5 23 exclusively to provide scholarships or tuition grants to Iowa
  5 24 residents attending the qualified postsecondary educational
  5 25 institution.  Fourth, the scholarships and tuition grants must
  5 26 be paid exclusively from the earnings of the fund and must not
  5 27 exceed five percent of the fund assets per year.  The entity
  5 28 establishing the endow Iowa scholarship fund must register the
  5 29 fund with the economic development authority (EDA), and the EDA
  5 30 shall not register more than one endow Iowa scholarship fund
  5 31 per qualified postsecondary educational institution.
  5 32    In addition to the $6 million that may be authorized per
  5 33 calendar year under current law for endowment gifts to endow
  5 34 Iowa qualified community foundations, the bill provides that
  5 35 up to $3 million in tax credits may be authorized per year
  6  1 for endowment gifts to endow Iowa scholarship funds.  Of that
