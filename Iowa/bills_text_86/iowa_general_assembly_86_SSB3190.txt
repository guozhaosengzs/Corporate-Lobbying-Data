SOLAR
ENERGY
SYSTEM
TAX
CREDIT.
The
bill
amends
the
Iowa
9


solar
energy
system
tax
credit
in
Code
section
422.11L,
which
10


is
provided
for
the
installation
of
a
solar
energy
system
in
11


an
amount
equal
to
certain
percentages
of
related
federal
12


solar
energy
tax
credits.
The
bill
requires
that
tax
credit
13


applications
be
accepted
and
approved
by
the
department
on
a
14


first-come,
first-served
basis
until
the
maximum
tax
credit
15


amount
that
may
be
claimed
each
tax
year
is
reached.
If
16


tax
credit
applications
exceed
that
maximum
amount
for
a
tax
17


year,
the
bill
requires
the
department
to
establish
a
tax
18


credit
wait
list,
and
applications
that
were
filed
by
the
19


May
1
deadline
but
not
approved
will
be
placed
on
the
wait
20


list
and
given
priority
for
having
their
application
approved
21


in
succeeding
years.
The
bill
states
that
placement
on
the
22


wait
list
does
not
constitute
a
promise
binding
the
state,
23


and
the
availability
of
a
tax
credit
and
approval
of
a
tax
24


credit
application
in
a
future
year
is
contingent
upon
the
25


availability
of
tax
credits
in
that
particular
year.
26


The
bill
also
defines
“Internal
Revenue
Code”
(IRC)
for
27


purposes
of
the
Iowa
solar
energy
system
tax
credit
to
mean
28


the
IRC
in
effect
on
January
1,
2016.
Under
current
law
for
29


purposes
of
the
Iowa
tax
credit,
IRC
means
that
in
effect
on
30


January
1,
2015.
This
change
has
the
effect
of
incorporating
31


into
the
Iowa
tax
credit
changes
made
by
Congress
in
2015
32


to
the
related
federal
energy
system
credits
for
tax
years
33


beginning
in
2017
or
later.
In
2015,
Congress
extended
the
34


expiration
date
for
several
of
the
federal
energy
system

SALES
AND
USE
TAXES.
A
sales
tax
exemption
is
provided
under
6


current
law
to
contractors,
subcontractors,
and
builders
for
7


the
purchase
of

materials,
supplies,
and
equipment
8


for
use
in
the
performance
of
a

contract
with
9


a

The
bill
amends
the
definition
10


of
“designated

entity”
to
include
an
instrumentality
11


of
a
county
or
municipal
government,
including

such

agreement,
real
14


property
located
within
a
reinvestment
district
established
15


under
the
Iowa
Reinvestment
Act
in
Code
chapter

The

Iowa
Reinvestment
Act,
in
general,
authorizes
municipalities
17


to
establish
reinvestment
districts
and
receive

18

motel
tax

collected

for

undertaking

21


By
operation
of
Code
section
423.6,
an
item
exempt
from
the
22


imposition
of
the
sales
tax
is
also
exempt
from

tax
