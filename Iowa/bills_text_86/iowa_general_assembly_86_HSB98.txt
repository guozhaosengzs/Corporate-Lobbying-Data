Before
being

an

1


is
required
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
EDA
for
the
2


successful
completion
of
all
requirements
of
the
program.
The
3


EDA
is
authorized
to
impose
two
compliance
cost
fees
under
the
4


program.
The
first
fee
equals
$500

The
second
5


fee
equals
0.5
percent
of
the
value
of
the
tax

claimed
6


pursuant
to
the
agreement
if
the
agreement
has
an
aggregate
tax

An

that
fails
to
comply
with
the
9


requirements

13


Upon
determining
that
all

the

shall
issue
a

The

The

modifies
the

Under

the

The

The
division
strikes
a
provision
permitting
the
EDA
3


to
cooperate
with
small
business
development
centers
to
4


disseminate
information
regarding
the
credits
and
to
develop
5


standard
application
forms,
and
requiring
the
EDA
to
distribute
6


copies
of
the
application
forms
to
all
community-based
seed
7


capital
funds
and
potential
individual
investors.
8


The
division
modifies
the
eligibility
requirements
for
9


qualifying
businesses.
The
division
strikes
the
requirement
10


that
a
business
have
an
owner
that
meets
at
least
one
of
11


four
qualifications
relating
to
business
education
or
12


business
experience.
The
division
requires
that
a
business
13


be
participating
in
an
entrepreneurial
assistance
program,
14


as
defined
in
the
division,
but
allows
the
EDA
to
waive
this
15


requirement
if
the
business
establishes
that
its
owners,
16


directors,
officers,
and
employees
have
an
appropriate
level
17


of
experience
such
that
an
entrepreneurial
assistance
program
18


would
not
materially
change
the
prospects
of
the
business.
19


The
EDA
is
allowed
to
consult
with
outside
service
providers
20


in
considering
such
a
waiver.
The
division
increases
from
$5
21


million
to
$10
million
the
maximum
amount
of
net
worth
that
22


a
business
may
have
to
be
considered
a
qualifying
business.
23


The
division
increases
from
$250,000
to
$500,000
the
amount
of
24


financing
that
a
business
must
have
in
order
to
be
considered
a
25


qualifying
business,
removes
“near
equity”
from
the
types
of
26


financing
that
will
be
considered
in
that
calculation,
requires
27


that
the
financing
be
secured
at
the
time
of
application
for
28


the
tax
credits,
and
requires
that
the
business
have
at
least
29


two
investors
at
the
time
of
application
for
the
tax
credits.
30


These
modified
eligibility
requirements
apply
to
businesses
31


that
submit
an
application
to
the
EDA
to
be
registered
as
a
32


qualifying
business
on
or

certain
other
programs,

The

amends

early-stage
12


innovation
companies
to
assist

Under
