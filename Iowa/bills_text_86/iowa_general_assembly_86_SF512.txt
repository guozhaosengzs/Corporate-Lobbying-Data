  3 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 17    This bill relates to state revenue and finance laws,
  3 18 including the sales and use tax, flood mitigation program, and

  3 22 vehicles used primarily in agricultural production from the
  3 23 sales and use tax. Under current law, such vehicles are not

  3 25 primarily used in production of agricultural products.
  3 26    "All=terrain vehicle" means a motorized vehicle with not
  3 27 less than three and not more than six nonhighway tires that
  3 28 is limited in engine displacement to less than 1,000 cubic

  3 33 not less than four and not more than eight nonhighway tires or
  3 34 rubberized tracks that has a seat that is of bucket or bench
  3 35 design, not intended to be straddled by the operator, and a
  4  1 steering wheel or control levers for control.
  4  2    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
  4  3 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
  4  4 imposed in Code section 423.5.

  4  6 the director of revenue, or a designee of the director, as an

  4  8 created in Code chapter 418.  The flood mitigation board is
  4  9 currently composed of nine voting members and four ex officio,
  4 10 nonvoting members who are members of the general assembly, and

  4 16 received by a nonresident from an electric utility for
  4 17 emergency response work performed in Iowa for the electric
  4 18 utility pursuant to a mutual aid agreement or for training

  4 20 also provides that nonresidents engaged in such emergency
  4 21 response work or training are not subject to individual
  4 22 income tax withholding requirements for the exempt payments if
  4 23 the electric utility for which such emergency response work
  4 24 or training is being performed applies for and receives a
  4 25 withholding exemption from the department of revenue.  Division
  4 26 III takes effect upon enactment and applies retroactively to
