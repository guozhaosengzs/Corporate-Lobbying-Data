  5  2 is located the amount of bonds issued under this chapter,
  5  3 including interest on the bonds, that qualify for payment

  5  9 provided in paragraphs "b" and "c", until the amount of the
  5 10 bonds, including the interest on the bonds, is paid. If any

  5 24 the reduction shall certify the amount of the reduction to the
  5 25 department of management and each appropriate county auditor.
  5 26    c.  In any year, the department of management shall, upon
  5 27 receipt of a certified request from an agency filed on or
  5 28 before December 1, decrease the amount of replacement tax
  5 29 revenue to be allocated under this section in order to reduce
  5 30 the amount to be allocated to the agency under this section
  5 31 in the next tax year to an amount that is less than the full
  5 32 portion of taxes which could be allocated.  Upon receipt of

  9 33 gas distribution agency for a tax year is the total amount
  9 34 of statewide property taxes under Code section 437A.18 and

  8 35    Code chapter 28F provides a means for the joint financing
  9  1 by public agencies of works or facilities for the collection,
  9  2 treatment, purification, and disposal in a sanitary manner
  9  3 of liquid and solid waste, sewage, and industrial waste,
  9  4 facilities used for the conversion of solid waste to energy,
  9  5 and also electric power facilities constructed within the
  9  6 state of Iowa.  Code chapter 28F applies to the acquisition,
  9  7 construction, reconstruction, ownership, operation, repair,
  9  8 extension, or improvement of such works or facilities by a
  9  9 separate administrative or legal entity created pursuant to
  9 10 Code chapter 28E or Code chapter 389.
  9 11    This bill adds facilities and works for the storage,
  9 12 transportation, transmission, and delivery of natural gas to
  9 13 the types of works and facilities that may be jointly financed
  9 14 by public agencies under Code chapter 28F.
  9 15    Current Code chapter 28F authorizes joint agencies to
  9 16 issue revenue bonds to finance such works or facilities that
  9 17 are payable from the net revenues of the project and other
  9 18 revenues that the entity may have and which are lawfully
  9 19 available for the payment of revenue bonds.  New Code section
  9 20 28F.5A authorizes a natural gas distribution agency that is
  9 21 undertaking a project to acquire, construct, reconstruct,
  9 22 operate, repair, extend, or improve natural gas facilities and
  9 23 works used for the storage, transportation, transmission, and
  9 24 delivery of natural gas to authorize, by resolution, the use of
  9 25 certain replacement tax revenue collected under Code chapter
  9 26 437A for the payment of bonds issued under Code chapter 28F.
  9 27    Under the bill, for each tax year after a designated base
  9 28 year, the natural gas distribution agency that has adopted the
  9 29 required resolution shall receive an amount of replacement
  9 30 tax paid by the agency under Code chapter 437A in an amount
  9 31 not to exceed the maximum amount allowed in the bill.  The
  9 32 maximum amount of replacement tax that may be paid to a natural
  9 33 gas distribution agency for a tax year is the total amount
  9 34 of statewide property taxes under Code section 437A.18 and
  9 35 replacement taxes paid by the natural gas distribution agency
 10  1 in the tax year minus the total amount of statewide property
 10  2 taxes under Code section 437A.18 and replacement taxes paid by
 10  3 the natural gas distribution agency in the base year.
 10  4    The bill requires the natural gas distribution agency to
 10  5 certify to the department of management and the county auditor
 10  6 of each county in which the replacement tax district is located
 10  7 the amount of bonds issued under this Code chapter, including
 10  8 interest on the bonds, that qualify for payment from the
 10  9 replacement tax revenue received under this Code section.  The
 10 10 bill also requires a natural gas distribution agency receiving
 10 11 replacement tax revenue to, on or before March 1 of each year,

  8 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 35    Code chapter 28F provides a means for the joint financing
  9  1 by public agencies of works or facilities for the collection,
  9  2 treatment, purification, and disposal in a sanitary manner
  9  3 of liquid and solid waste, sewage, and industrial waste,
  9  4 facilities used for the conversion of solid waste to energy,
  9  5 and also electric power facilities constructed within the
  9  6 state of Iowa.  Code chapter 28F applies to the acquisition,
  9  7 construction, reconstruction, ownership, operation, repair,
  9  8 extension, or improvement of such works or facilities by a
  9  9 separate administrative or legal entity created pursuant to
  9 10 Code chapter 28E or Code chapter 389.
  9 11    This bill adds facilities and works for the storage,
  9 12 transportation, transmission, and delivery of natural gas to
  9 13 the types of works and facilities that may be jointly financed
  9 14 by public agencies under Code chapter 28F.
  9 15    Current Code chapter 28F authorizes joint agencies to
  9 16 issue revenue bonds to finance such works or facilities that
  9 17 are payable from the net revenues of the project and other
  9 18 revenues that the entity may have and which are lawfully
  9 19 available for the payment of revenue bonds.  New Code section
  9 20 28F.5A authorizes a natural gas distribution agency that is
  9 21 undertaking a project to acquire, construct, reconstruct,
  9 22 operate, repair, extend, or improve natural gas facilities and
  9 23 works used for the storage, transportation, transmission, and
  9 24 delivery of natural gas to authorize, by resolution, the use of
  9 25 certain replacement tax revenue collected under Code chapter
  9 26 437A for the payment of bonds issued under Code chapter 28F.
  9 27    Under the bill, for each tax year after a designated base
  9 28 year, the natural gas distribution agency that has adopted the
  9 29 required resolution shall receive an amount of replacement
  9 30 tax paid by the agency under Code chapter 437A in an amount
  9 31 not to exceed the maximum amount allowed in the bill.  The
  9 32 maximum amount of replacement tax that may be paid to a natural
  9 33 gas distribution agency for a tax year is the total amount
  9 34 of statewide property taxes under Code section 437A.18 and
  9 35 replacement taxes paid by the natural gas distribution agency
 10  1 in the tax year minus the total amount of statewide property
 10  2 taxes under Code section 437A.18 and replacement taxes paid by
 10  3 the natural gas distribution agency in the base year.
 10  4    The bill requires the natural gas distribution agency to
