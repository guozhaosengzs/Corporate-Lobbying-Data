  3 15 statement must disclose any known illness or disease afflicting
  3 16 the dog or cat and any congenital or hereditary condition that

  3 24 warranty as required by the department.
  3 25    9.  This section shall not limit rights or remedies available

  3 30 prevails in such an action the amount of any pecuniary loss,
  3 31 together with costs and reasonable attorney fees which shall
  3 32 be taxed as part of the costs of the action, and any equitable

  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of
  5  7 registration; pet shops which are required to obtain a state
  5  8 license; and commercial breeders which are required to obtain
  5  9 a state license or a permit if licensed by the United States
  5 10 department of agriculture (USDA).

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of
  5  7 registration; pet shops which are required to obtain a state
  5  8 license; and commercial breeders which are required to obtain
  5  9 a state license or a permit if licensed by the United States

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of
  5  7 registration; pet shops which are required to obtain a state
  5  8 license; and commercial breeders which are required to obtain
  5  9 a state license or a permit if licensed by the United States
  5 10 department of agriculture (USDA).

  2  4 of a contagious or infectious disease or an obvious sign of

  2  7 not include the presence of fleas or ticks.
  2  8    b.  A congenital or hereditary condition that adversely
  2  9 affects the health of the dog or cat, if the condition results

  2 12 surgical procedure performed on the dog or cat, as recommended
  2 13 by a veterinarian.

  2 28 qualified purchaser to a licensed veterinarian for diagnosing
  2 29 and treating the dog or cat during the twenty=one=day period.
  2 30 The reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of consideration
  2 31 paid by the qualified purchaser to the seller for the dog or
  2 32 cat.
  2 33    6.  An express warranty shall not cover the condition of a
  2 34 dog or cat that arises after the seller transfers possession of

  3 14 a written statement waiving the express warranty.  The written
  3 15 statement must disclose any known illness or disease afflicting
  3 16 the dog or cat and any congenital or hereditary condition that

  3 18 statement by the parties, the seller shall not be subject to a
  3 19 claim as described in subsection 5.
  3 20    8.  A commercial establishment that transfers a dog or cat
  3 21 must post a notice at a conspicuous public location in the
  3 22 commercial establishment's principal place of business. The
  3 23 notice must briefly explain the terms and conditions of the
  3 24 warranty as required by the department.

  3 26 to a qualified purchaser under any other law.  In addition to
  3 27 pursuing any other remedy, a qualified purchaser who is not
  3 28 compensated under this section may bring an action in district
  3 29 court.  The court shall award a qualified purchaser who
  3 30 prevails in such an action the amount of any pecuniary loss,

  3 32 be taxed as part of the costs of the action, and any equitable

  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of
  5  7 registration; pet shops which are required to obtain a state
  5  8 license; and commercial breeders which are required to obtain
  5  9 a state license or a permit if licensed by the United States

  2 31 paid by the qualified purchaser to the seller for the dog or
  2 32 cat.
  2 33    6.  An express warranty shall not cover the condition of a
  2 34 dog or cat that arises after the seller transfers possession of

  3  7 under section 162.10A, subsection 1.
  3  8    d.  Any condition that could be reasonably attributable to

  3 12    7.  Any waiver of a right by a qualified purchaser under this
  3 13 section is void, unless the qualified purchaser and seller sign
  3 14 a written statement waiving the express warranty.  The written
  3 15 statement must disclose any known illness or disease afflicting
  3 16 the dog or cat and any congenital or hereditary condition that
  3 17 adversely affects the dog or cat. Upon the signing of the

  3 19 claim as described in subsection 5.
  3 20    8.  A commercial establishment that transfers a dog or cat

  3 23 notice must briefly explain the terms and conditions of the
  3 24 warranty as required by the department.
  3 25    9.  This section shall not limit rights or remedies available
  3 26 to a qualified purchaser under any other law.  In addition to
  3 27 pursuing any other remedy, a qualified purchaser who is not
  3 28 compensated under this section may bring an action in district
  3 29 court.  The court shall award a qualified purchaser who
  3 30 prevails in such an action the amount of any pecuniary loss,
  3 31 together with costs and reasonable attorney fees which shall
  3 32 be taxed as part of the costs of the action, and any equitable

  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to

  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.

  3 16 the dog or cat and any congenital or hereditary condition that

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of
  5  7 registration; pet shops which are required to obtain a state
  5  8 license; and commercial breeders which are required to obtain
  5  9 a state license or a permit if licensed by the United States
  5 10 department of agriculture (USDA).

  3 11 animal under chapter 717B.
  3 12    7.  Any waiver of a right by a qualified purchaser under this
  3 13 section is void, unless the qualified purchaser and seller sign
  3 14 a written statement waiving the express warranty.  The written
  3 15 statement must disclose any known illness or disease afflicting
  3 16 the dog or cat and any congenital or hereditary condition that
  3 17 adversely affects the dog or cat. Upon the signing of the
  3 18 statement by the parties, the seller shall not be subject to a
  3 19 claim as described in subsection 5.
  3 20    8.  A commercial establishment that transfers a dog or cat

  3 27 pursuing any other remedy, a qualified purchaser who is not
  3 28 compensated under this section may bring an action in district
  3 29 court.  The court shall award a qualified purchaser who
  3 30 prevails in such an action the amount of any pecuniary loss,
  3 31 together with costs and reasonable attorney fees which shall
  3 32 be taxed as part of the costs of the action, and any equitable

  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of

  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the

  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes

  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid

  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of
  5  7 registration; pet shops which are required to obtain a state
  5  8 license; and commercial breeders which are required to obtain

  3  3    b.  An injury sustained by the dog or cat.

  3  6 same standard of care applicable to commercial establishments
  3  7 under section 162.10A, subsection 1.
  3  8    d.  Any condition that could be reasonably attributable to

  3 11 animal under chapter 717B.
  3 12    7.  Any waiver of a right by a qualified purchaser under this
  3 13 section is void, unless the qualified purchaser and seller sign
  3 14 a written statement waiving the express warranty.  The written
  3 15 statement must disclose any known illness or disease afflicting
  3 16 the dog or cat and any congenital or hereditary condition that
  3 17 adversely affects the dog or cat. Upon the signing of the
  3 18 statement by the parties, the seller shall not be subject to a
  3 19 claim as described in subsection 5.
  3 20    8.  A commercial establishment that transfers a dog or cat
  3 21 must post a notice at a conspicuous public location in the
  3 22 commercial establishment's principal place of business. The
  3 23 notice must briefly explain the terms and conditions of the
  3 24 warranty as required by the department.
  3 25    9.  This section shall not limit rights or remedies available
  3 26 to a qualified purchaser under any other law.  In addition to
  3 27 pursuing any other remedy, a qualified purchaser who is not
  3 28 compensated under this section may bring an action in district
  3 29 court.  The court shall award a qualified purchaser who
  3 30 prevails in such an action the amount of any pecuniary loss,
  3 31 together with costs and reasonable attorney fees which shall
  3 32 be taxed as part of the costs of the action, and any equitable
  3 33 relief that the court determines is appropriate.

  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,

  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express

  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.

  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of

  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.

  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.

  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own

  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes

  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or

  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.

  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is

  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes

  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill requires that when a person
  4  3 (seller) transfers possession and ownership of a dog or cat,
  4  4 by sale or exchange, to another person for that person's own
  4  5 personal use and enjoyment (qualified purchaser), the seller
  4  6 must furnish the qualified purchaser with an express warranty
  4  7 in written form covering damages caused by the condition of
  4  8 the dog or cat at the time of sale or exchange. The express
  4  9 warranty applies regardless of whether the seller provides the
  4 10 qualified purchaser with a specific written form required to be
  4 11 promulgated by the department.  The express warranty expires
  4 12 21 days from the date that the qualified purchaser takes
  4 13 possession of the dog or cat. The express warranty covers
  4 14 illness, disease, or a congenital or hereditary condition.  The
  4 15 express warranty allows the qualified purchaser to make a claim
  4 16 for compensation in one of three forms: (1) return of the paid
  4 17 consideration (refund), (2) exchange for another dog or cat, or
  4 18 (3) reimbursement of veterinarian fees.  However, the express
  4 19 warranty does not cover a condition that occurred after the
  4 20 seller transfers possession of the dog or cat to the qualified
  4 21 purchaser. The parties may execute a statement waiving the
  4 22 express warranty, so long as the statement discloses any known
  4 23 illness or disease afflicting the dog or cat and any congenital
  4 24 or hereditary condition that adversely affects the dog or cat.
  4 25    The bill requires a commercial establishment to post a
  4 26 notice briefly explaining the express warranty in a conspicuous
  4 27 place.
  4 28    The bill does not limit the rights or remedies provided to
  4 29 qualified purchasers under other law.  A qualified purchaser
  4 30 who does not receive compensation from the seller may bring an
  4 31 action in court to recover pecuniary damages plus court costs
  4 32 and reasonable attorney fees, which are to be taxed as part of
  4 33 the costs of the action.  In addition, the court may grant any
  4 34 equitable relief that the court determines is appropriate.
  4 35    CIVIL PENALTY.  A seller violating the bill's provisions is
  5  1 subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500 and each day
  5  2 that the seller fails to honor an express warranty constitutes
  5  3 a separate offense.
  5  4    BACKGROUND.  Commercial establishments that are involved in
  5  5 the sale or exchange of dogs and cats include animal shelters
  5  6 and pounds which are required to obtain a certificate of
  5  7 registration; pet shops which are required to obtain a state
