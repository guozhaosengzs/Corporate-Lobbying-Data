  5 16 multidisciplinary teams throughout the state.
  5 17    j.  Enable all parties providing assistance to have access to
  5 18 information needed to maximize assistance to victims of elder

  5 32                           EXPLANATION
  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department
  6 32 of human services, department of inspections and appeals,
  6 33 department of public health, the office of long=term
  6 34 care ombudsman, and the office of the attorney general to

  7  8 abuse including physical abuse, emotional or psychological
  7  9 abuse, sexual abuse, financial or material exploitation, and
  7 10 abandonment, neglect, and self=neglect; specify who should
  7 11 be a mandatory reporter of elder abuse; specify a penalty
  7 12 for failure to report elder abuse; include consequences for
  7 13 perpetrators of elder abuse; provide for a central elder abuse
  7 14 registry; specify educational and training requirements for
  7 15 staff of the agencies that address prevention, detection,
  7 16 and investigation of elder abuse; specify who will provide
  7 17 legal assistance for victims of elder abuse; include services
  7 18 provisions; recognize the multidisciplinary team as an
  7 19 essential element of an elder abuse system and require entities
  7 20 to work together to  establish local multidisciplinary teams
  7 21 throughout the state; enable all parties providing assistance
  7 22 to have access to information needed to maximize assistance to
  7 23 victims of elder abuse while maintaining the privacy of the
  7 24 victims; utilize the aging and disability resource centers
  7 25 as the named contact source for elder abuse reporting while
  7 26 building upon the collaborative no=wrong door approach; and
  7 27 provide for designated elder abuse investigators who are not

  7 29 bill requires the agencies and offices to submit a report to
  7 30 the governor and the general assembly by December 15, 2015,
  7 31 including draft legislation as specified in the bill.

  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a

  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department

  7 13 perpetrators of elder abuse; provide for a central elder abuse
  7 14 registry; specify educational and training requirements for

  5 32                           EXPLANATION
  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department

  7 12 for failure to report elder abuse; include consequences for
  7 13 perpetrators of elder abuse; provide for a central elder abuse
  7 14 registry; specify educational and training requirements for
  7 15 staff of the agencies that address prevention, detection,
  7 16 and investigation of elder abuse; specify who will provide

  7 18 provisions; recognize the multidisciplinary team as an
  7 19 essential element of an elder abuse system and require entities

  7 21 throughout the state; enable all parties providing assistance
  7 22 to have access to information needed to maximize assistance to
  7 23 victims of elder abuse while maintaining the privacy of the
  7 24 victims; utilize the aging and disability resource centers

  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest

  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of

  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the

  7 13 perpetrators of elder abuse; provide for a central elder abuse
  7 14 registry; specify educational and training requirements for
  7 15 staff of the agencies that address prevention, detection,

  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department

  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court

  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court

  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.

  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount

  7 13 perpetrators of elder abuse; provide for a central elder abuse
  7 14 registry; specify educational and training requirements for
  7 15 staff of the agencies that address prevention, detection,

  7 17 legal assistance for victims of elder abuse; include services
  7 18 provisions; recognize the multidisciplinary team as an

  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby

  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as

  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also

  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.

  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department

  7 11 be a mandatory reporter of elder abuse; specify a penalty
  7 12 for failure to report elder abuse; include consequences for
  7 13 perpetrators of elder abuse; provide for a central elder abuse
  7 14 registry; specify educational and training requirements for
  7 15 staff of the agencies that address prevention, detection,

  7 17 legal assistance for victims of elder abuse; include services
  7 18 provisions; recognize the multidisciplinary team as an
  7 19 essential element of an elder abuse system and require entities
  7 20 to work together to  establish local multidisciplinary teams
  7 21 throughout the state; enable all parties providing assistance
  7 22 to have access to information needed to maximize assistance to
  7 23 victims of elder abuse while maintaining the privacy of the

  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court

  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a

  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department

  7 13 perpetrators of elder abuse; provide for a central elder abuse
  7 14 registry; specify educational and training requirements for

  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a

  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as

  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court

  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.

  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a

  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position

  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,

  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court

  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of

  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a

  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,

  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also

  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department

  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,

  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also

  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.

  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department

  5 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.
  6 31    The bill directs the department on aging, department

  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of

  5 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 35    This bill includes provisions relating to elder abuse and
  6  1 financial exploitation.   The bill eliminates a listing of
  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead
  6  7 that the determination of the existence of a confidential
  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as
  6 11 a potential substitute petitioner any other interested person,
  6 12 and instead including a person who has a demonstrated interest
  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court

  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
  6 23 trust or confidence with the older individual and knowingly
  6 24 and by undue influence, deception, coercion, fraud, breach of
  6 25 fiduciary duty, or extortion, obtains control over or otherwise
  6 26 uses the benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets
  6 27 of the older individual. The criminal penalties range from a
  6 28 simple misdemeanor to a class "C" felony based on the amount
  6 29 of benefits, property, resources, belongings, or assets of the
  6 30 older individual involved.

  6  2 persons who were exempt from the confidential relationship
  6  3 requirement in order to be considered as standing in a position
  6  4 of trust or confidence with a vulnerable elder and thereby
  6  5 potentially subject to an allegation of financial exploitation
  6  6 under the elder abuse Code chapter.  The bill provides instead

  6  8 relationship is an issue of fact to be determined by the court
  6  9 based upon the totality of the circumstances.
  6 10    The bill redefines "substitute petitioner" by eliminating as

  6 13 in the vulnerable elder.
  6 14    The bill provides that if a substitute petitioner files
  6 15 a petition for relief from elder abuse, the clerk of court
  6 16 shall provide notice to the vulnerable elder.  The bill also
  6 17 authorizes the court, in its discretion, to limit the number of
  6 18 petitions filed and the timeframe within which multiple filings
  6 19 of petitions may be made involving the same vulnerable elder.
  6 20    The bill establishes the crime of financial exploitation of
  6 21 an older individual. A person commits financial exploitation
  6 22 of an older individual when the person stands in a position of
