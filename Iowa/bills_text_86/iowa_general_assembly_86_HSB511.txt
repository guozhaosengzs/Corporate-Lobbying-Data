_____


the
administrative
procedure
Act,
Code
chapter
17A,
and
the
1


provisions
of
the
bill.
The
bill
establishes
time
frames
for
2


the
contested
case
proceeding
and
also
provides
for
mediation
3


in
lieu
of
the
contested
case
proceeding.
A
contested
case
4


proceeding
on
an
application
is
to
be
heard
and
presided
over
5


by
an
administrative
law
judge
sitting
alone,
and
the
hearing
6


is
to
be
conducted
as
a
matter
of
first
impression
subject
7


to
de
novo
review.
The
subject
matter
of
the
contested
case
8


proceeding
is
limited
to
the
single
application
and
is
not
to
9


concern
the
merits
of
any
other
pending
application
of
the
same
10


applicant.
Once
the
administrative
law
judge
makes
a
proposed
11


decision
on
the
application,
the
proposed
decision
becomes
a
12


final
decision
unless
a
party
appeals
to
the
department
within
13


the
specified
time
frames.
If
the
department
declines
to
hear
14


an
appeal
on
a
proposed
decision,
the
proposed
decision
is
a
15


final
decision
and
may
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
A
party
16


who
is
aggrieved
or
adversely
affected
by
a
final
decision
17


under
the
bill
is
entitled
to
judicial
review.
The
costs
18


of
a
contested
case
hearing
are
to
be
paid
equally
by
all
19


nonprevailing
parties.
No
costs
are
to
be
assessed
against
20


the
department.
The
procedure
does
not
apply
to
contested
21


cases
initiated
by
the
health
facilities
council
regarding
22


certificate
of
need
decisions.
23


The
bill
makes
other
conforming
changes
to
reflect
the
new
24


procedure
for
contested
certificate
of
need
applications.
