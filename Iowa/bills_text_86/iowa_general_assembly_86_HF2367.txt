  3 35                           EXPLANATION
  4  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  3    This bill relates to the establishment of prearrest
  4  4 diversion programs for certain simple misdemeanants.
  4  5    The bill permits the board of directors of a judicial
  4  6 district department of correctional services to establish a
  4  7 prearrest diversion program.
  4  8    Under the bill, the prearrest diversion of a criminal
  4  9 offender begins with the issuance of a civil citation.  The
  4 10 bill provides that a person may be issued a civil citation,
  4 11 at the sole discretion of a peace officer, in lieu of issuing
  4 12 a criminal citation or making arrest for certain simple
  4 13 misdemeanors or similar local ordinance, if the person accepts
  4 14 responsibility for the commission of the criminal offense, the
  4 15 person has not been previously been arrested as an adult for
  4 16 such an offense, and a prearrest diversion program has been
  4 17 established by the board of directors of the judicial district.
  4 18    The bill provides that a person's acceptance of
  4 19 responsibility for the commission of the criminal offense shall
  4 20 not be considered a confession and shall not be admissible in a
  4 21 criminal prosecution for the underlying criminal offense.
  4 22    The bill specifies that a civil citation is not subject to
  4 23 examination or disclosure under Code chapter 22.
  4 24    The bill prohibits the participation of a criminal offender
  4 25 in the program if the criminal offense involves a victim and
  4 26 the victim objects to the participation.
  4 27    Under the bill, a person who receives a civil citation
  4 28 shall report for orientation at the time and place specified
  4 29 by the prearrest diversion program.  The bill specifies that
  4 30 orientation may include but is not limited to any combination
  4 31 of the following: an assessment, intervention, educational
  4 32 instruction, or mental health or substance abuse=related
  4 33 treatment.
  4 34    After completion of orientation, the person may be required
  4 35 to perform community service hours specified by the prearrest
  5  1 diversion program.
  5  2    If the person does not complete orientation and the
  5  3 community service hours required, if any, within a specified
  5  4 time period, the bill requires the law enforcement agency
  5  5 issuing the civil citation to criminally charge the person with
  5  6 the criminal offense that prompted the issuance of the civil
  5  7 citation, and the criminal offense shall be referred to the
  5  8 county attorney for criminal prosecution.
  5  9    If the person successfully completes the prearrest diversion
  5 10 program, the bill prohibits an arrest record to be associated
  5 11 with the commission of the criminal offense that prompted the
  5 12 issuance of the civil citation.
  5 13    The bill further specifies that the issuance of a civil
  5 14 citation or the underlying criminal offense that prompted
  5 15 the issuance of the civil citation shall not appear in or be
  5 16 considered a part of a person's arrest data, correctional data,
  5 17 or disposition data under Code chapter 692, upon the successful
  5 18 completion of a prearrest diversion program.
  5 19    The bill also provides that the court's record, if any, of
  5 20 the issuance of the civil citation or the underlying criminal
  5 21 offense that prompted the issuance of the civil citation
  5 22 shall be expunged as defined in Code section 907.1, upon the
  5 23 successful completion of the prearrest diversion program.
  5 24    The criminal offenses eligible for the issuance of a civil
  5 25 citation under the bill include all simple misdemeanors or
  5 26 violations of similar local ordinances except for possession
  5 27 of drug paraphernalia in violation of Code section 124.414 or
  5 28 domestic abuse assault in violation of Code section 708.2A.
  5 29    The bill requires a person placed in a prearrest diversion
  5 30 program to pay an enrollment fee of $300 to the judicial
  5 31 district to offset the costs of the program.  In addition to
  5 32 the enrollment fee, the bill allows the judicial district to
  5 33 charge a fee to offset the costs of other programming provided
  5 34 to the person placed in the program. The bill allows the
  5 35 judicial district to retain the fees collected pursuant to the
  6  1 bill.  The bill provides that the department of corrections
  6  2 may adopt rules on behalf of a judicial district to administer
  6  3 the bill, but any rules, if adopted, shall include a provision
  6  4 for waiving the collection of fees for persons determined to
  6  5 be unable to pay.
  6  6    The bill prohibits the commencement of any civil or criminal
  6  7 action against a peace officer for exercising discretion when
  6  8 issuing a civil citation in lieu of a criminal citation.  The
  6  9 bill also requires the governing body to defend a peace officer
  6 10 from civil actions filed against the officer for issuing a
  6 11 civil citation in lieu of a criminal citation under the bill.

  4 15 person has not been previously been arrested as an adult for
  4 16 such an offense, and a prearrest diversion program has been
  4 17 established by the board of directors of the judicial district.
  4 18    The bill provides that a person's acceptance of
  4 19 responsibility for the commission of the criminal offense shall
  4 20 not be considered a confession and shall not be admissible in a
  4 21 criminal prosecution for the underlying criminal offense.
  4 22    The bill specifies that a civil citation is not subject to
  4 23 examination or disclosure under Code chapter 22.
  4 24    The bill prohibits the participation of a criminal offender
  4 25 in the program if the criminal offense involves a victim and
  4 26 the victim objects to the participation.
  4 27    Under the bill, a person who receives a civil citation
  4 28 shall report for orientation at the time and place specified

  5  1 diversion program.
  5  2    If the person does not complete orientation and the

  5  4 time period, the bill requires the law enforcement agency
  5  5 issuing the civil citation to criminally charge the person with
  5  6 the criminal offense that prompted the issuance of the civil
  5  7 citation, and the criminal offense shall be referred to the

  5  9    If the person successfully completes the prearrest diversion
  5 10 program, the bill prohibits an arrest record to be associated
  5 11 with the commission of the criminal offense that prompted the
  5 12 issuance of the civil citation.
  5 13    The bill further specifies that the issuance of a civil
  5 14 citation or the underlying criminal offense that prompted
  5 15 the issuance of the civil citation shall not appear in or be
  5 16 considered a part of a person's arrest data, correctional data,

  5 18 completion of a prearrest diversion program.
  5 19    The bill also provides that the court's record, if any, of

  5 29    The bill requires a person placed in a prearrest diversion
  5 30 program to pay an enrollment fee of $300 to the judicial
  5 31 district to offset the costs of the program.  In addition to

  5  1 diversion program.
  5  2    If the person does not complete orientation and the
  5  3 community service hours required, if any, within a specified
  5  4 time period, the bill requires the law enforcement agency
  5  5 issuing the civil citation to criminally charge the person with
  5  6 the criminal offense that prompted the issuance of the civil
  5  7 citation, and the criminal offense shall be referred to the
  5  8 county attorney for criminal prosecution.
  5  9    If the person successfully completes the prearrest diversion

  5 12 issuance of the civil citation.
  5 13    The bill further specifies that the issuance of a civil
  5 14 citation or the underlying criminal offense that prompted
  5 15 the issuance of the civil citation shall not appear in or be
  5 16 considered a part of a person's arrest data, correctional data,
  5 17 or disposition data under Code chapter 692, upon the successful
  5 18 completion of a prearrest diversion program.
  5 19    The bill also provides that the court's record, if any, of
  5 20 the issuance of the civil citation or the underlying criminal
  5 21 offense that prompted the issuance of the civil citation
  5 22 shall be expunged as defined in Code section 907.1, upon the
  5 23 successful completion of the prearrest diversion program.
  5 24    The criminal offenses eligible for the issuance of a civil
  5 25 citation under the bill include all simple misdemeanors or
  5 26 violations of similar local ordinances except for possession

  5 32 the enrollment fee, the bill allows the judicial district to
  5 33 charge a fee to offset the costs of other programming provided
  5 34 to the person placed in the program. The bill allows the
  5 35 judicial district to retain the fees collected pursuant to the

  6  2 may adopt rules on behalf of a judicial district to administer
  6  3 the bill, but any rules, if adopted, shall include a provision
