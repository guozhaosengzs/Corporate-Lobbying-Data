classified
as
schedule
I
controlled
substances.
The
board
1


of
pharmacy
has
determined
that
these
substances
should
be
2


classified
as
schedule
I
controlled
substances
because
each
3


substance
has
a
high
potential
for
abuse
and
no
accepted
4


medical
use
in
the
United
States.

The
bill
removes
hydrocodone-combination
products
from
6


the
list
of
substances
classified
as
schedule

7


substances.
Hydrocodone,
as
a
single-entity
substance,
8


is
currently
classified
as
a
schedule
II
controlled
9


substance.
The
change
under
the
bill
effectively
makes
all
10


hydrocodone-containing

the
controls,
11


security,
reporting,
and
penalty
provisions
for
schedule

12


controlled

The
federal
food

16


recently
approved
naloxegol
for
the
treatment
of
opioid-induced
17


constipation
in
adults

also
removes

IV
controlled

This
substance
was
previously
27


marketed
and
distributed
as
a
noncontrolled
prescription
28


drug.
Effective
August
