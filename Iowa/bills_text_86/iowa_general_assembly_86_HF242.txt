  2 19 1, paragraph "b", with such students, an institution of higher
  2 20 learning under the control of the board shall review the sex
  2 21 offender registry information under section 692A.121 available
  2 22 to the general public for information regarding the applicant.
  2 23 The institution shall conduct the same review by June 30, 2016,
  2 24 for each instructor employed by the institution as of July
  2 25 1, 2015, to teach a course in which one or more high school
  2 26 students are or likely will be enrolled under chapter 261E

  3 21 school by June 30, 2016, for each employee employed by the
  3 22 school as of July 1, 2015, and shall implement a consistent
  3 23 policy to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  3 24 employed by the school on or after July 1, 2015, at least every
  3 25 five years after the school employee's initial date of hire.
  3 26                           EXPLANATION
  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the
  5 22 Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school for
  5 23 the deaf.

  2 35 or instructor for the cost of the registry check conducted
  3  1 pursuant to this subsection.  The institution shall maintain
  3  2 documentation demonstrating compliance with this section.
  3  3    2.  Being listed in the sex offender registry established

  3 14 to a background investigation pursuant to section 272.2,
  3 15 subsection 17, or section 279.13, subsection 1, paragraph "b".
  3 16    Sec. 4.  APPLICABILITY.  Pursuant to section 262.76,
  3 17 subsection 3, as enacted by this Act, the Iowa braille and
  3 18 sight saving school and the state school for the deaf shall
  3 19 establish a background investigation procedure, in accordance
  3 20 with section 279.69, for each school employee employed by each
  3 21 school by June 30, 2016, for each employee employed by the
  3 22 school as of July 1, 2015, and shall implement a consistent
  3 23 policy to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  3 24 employed by the school on or after July 1, 2015, at least every
  3 25 five years after the school employee's initial date of hire.
  3 26                           EXPLANATION
  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the
  5 22 Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school for
  5 23 the deaf.

  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an

  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled

  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high

  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,

  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration

  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.

  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's

  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must

  3 26                           EXPLANATION
  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the
  5 22 Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school for
  5 23 the deaf.

  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the
  5 22 Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school for
  5 23 the deaf.

  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry

  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an

  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,

  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state

  3 26                           EXPLANATION
  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the
  5 22 Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school for
  5 23 the deaf.

  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high

  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding

  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.

  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was

  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the

  3 23 policy to follow the same procedure for each school employee

  3 26                           EXPLANATION
  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the
  5 22 Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school for

  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section

  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,

  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must

  3 23 policy to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  3 24 employed by the school on or after July 1, 2015, at least every
  3 25 five years after the school employee's initial date of hire.
  3 26                           EXPLANATION
  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the

  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to

  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must

  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the
  5 22 Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school for

  3 26                           EXPLANATION
  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
  5 21 access to the dependent adult abuse registry information to the
  5 22 Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school for
  5 23 the deaf.

  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.

  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was

  3 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 29    This bill requires community colleges and regents
  3 30 universities to review the sex offender registry information
  3 31 available to the general public for information regarding an
  3 32 instructor or prospective instructor for a course in which one
  3 33 or more high school students are or likely will be enrolled
  3 34 under the senior year plus program, and in which the instructor
  3 35 will have personal contact with such students. The bill
  4  1 provides that the background investigation provisions regarding
  4  2 individuals employed by school districts apply to employees of
  4  3 the Iowa braille and sight saving school and the state school
  4  4 for the deaf.
  4  5    The community colleges and regents universities must conduct
  4  6 the same review by June 30, 2016, for each instructor employed
  4  7 as of July 1, 2015, for a course in which one or more high
  4  8 school students are or likely will be enrolled under Code
  4  9 chapter 261E and in which the instructor will have personal
  4 10 contact, as defined in Code section 708.7, subsection 1,
  4 11 paragraph "b", with such students.  The community colleges and
  4 12 regents universities must also implement a consistent policy
  4 13 to review the sex offender registry for information regarding
  4 14 each instructor employed on or after July 1, 2015, for such a
  4 15 course at least every five years after the instructor's initial
  4 16 date of hire, and must maintain documentation demonstrating
  4 17 compliance with the provisions of the bill. Applicants and
  4 18 instructors shall not be charged for the cost of the registry
  4 19 check.
  4 20    Being listed in the sex offender registry shall constitute
  4 21 grounds for the immediate suspension from duties of an
  4 22 instructor, pending, if the instructor is employed by a
  4 23 community college, a termination hearing by the administration
  4 24 of the community college. The termination hearing is limited
  4 25 to the question of whether the instructor was incorrectly
  4 26 listed in the registry.
  4 27    The bill defines "instructor" to mean instructors,
  4 28 professors, part=time, adjunct, or contract employees.
  4 29 "Instructor" does not include practitioners who are subject to
  4 30 a background investigation under other Code provisions.  The
  4 31 bill defines "personal contact" the same as Code section 708.7,
  4 32 which provides that personal contact means an encounter in
  4 33 which two or more people are in visual or physical proximity to
  4 34 each other, and does not require a physical touching or oral
  4 35 communication, although it may include these types of contacts.
  5  1  Under the bill, the Iowa braille and sight saving school and
  5  2 the state school for the deaf under the control of the state
  5  3 board of regents are subject to the provisions of Code section
  5  4 279.69, which require school districts, prior to hiring an
  5  5 applicant for a school employee position, to review the state
  5  6 sex offender registry, the state central registry for child
  5  7 abuse information, and the state central registry for dependent
  5  8 adult abuse information for information regarding any applicant
  5  9 for a school employee position before an applicant is hired,
  5 10 and to follow the same procedure for each school employee
  5 11 currently employed by the school district and to recheck every
  5 12 five years upon the anniversary of each school employee's
  5 13 year of hire. The  school district cannot charge an employee
  5 14 for the cost of the registry checks. A school district must
  5 15 document compliance with the requirements.  Being listed on any
  5 16 of the registries is grounds for the immediate suspension of a
  5 17 school employee, pending a termination hearing by the school
  5 18 board, limited to the question of whether a school employee was
  5 19 incorrectly listed in one of the registries.
  5 20    The bill amends Code section 235B.6 to provide limited
