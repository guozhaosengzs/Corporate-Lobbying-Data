EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


Under
current
law,
a
civil
penalty
is
imposed
on
a
person
4


whose
driver’s
license
or
nonresident
operating
privilege
5


has
been
suspended,
revoked,
or
barred
by
the
department
of
6


transportation
for
a
violation
of
Code
chapter
321
(motor
7


vehicles
and
laws
of
the
road),
321A
(motor
vehicle
financial
8


responsibility),
or
321J
(operating
while
intoxicated).
For
9


a
violation
of
Code
chapter
321
or
321A,
the
civil
penalty
is
10


$200,
or
if
the
person
is
age
19
or
under,
the
civil
penalty
is
11


$50.
The
moneys
derived
from
these
two
penalties
are
deposited
12


in
the
juvenile
detention
home
fund
created
under
Code
section
13


232.142.
For
a
violation
of
Code
chapter
321J,
the
civil
14


penalty
is
$200.
The
moneys
derived
from
this
penalty
are
15


deposited
in
the
victim
compensation
fund
created
under
Code
16


section
915.94
and
the
general
fund
of
the
state.
17


This
bill
repeals
those
civil
penalties.
The
bill
also
18


strikes
related
provisions
regarding
payment
of
the
civil
19


penalties
in
installment
agreements,
collection
of
the
civil
20


penalties
by
county
treasurers,
and
allocation
of
the
moneys
21


collected
from
the
civil
penalties.
The
bill
leaves
the
22


juvenile
detention
home
fund
intact,
but
without
a
source
of
23


statutorily
required
deposits.
