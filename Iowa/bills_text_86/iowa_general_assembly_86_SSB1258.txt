must
require
that
18


the
practice
be
maintained
for
a
specific
number
of
years.
19


The
agreement
does
not
create
a
lien

successor
in
interest.
It

It
also
provides
29


for
the
transferability
of
the
tax
credit
certificate
to
any
30


number
of
subsequent

Not
more
than
$3
million
in
31

credit
certificates
may
be
issued
in
