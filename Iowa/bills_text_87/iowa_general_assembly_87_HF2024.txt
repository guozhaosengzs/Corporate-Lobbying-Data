  2  7    Sec. 3.  Section 8A.512A, Code 2018, is amended by striking
  2  8 the section and inserting in lieu thereof the following:
  2  9    8A.512A  Executive branch employee travel.
  2 10    1.  A claim for reimbursement for any out=of=state travel,
  2 11 conference, or related expenditures of an executive branch
  2 12 employee associated with the employee's official duties shall
  2 13 be allowed upon the approval of the claim by the head of the
  2 14 employee's state agency. A state agency with authority to
  2 15 approve claims under this section shall establish a process
  2 16 for a detailed review of claims selected by the department to
  2 17 determine the appropriateness of the claims for reimbursement.
  2 18    2.  a.  For purposes of this section, "executive branch
  2 19 employee" means an employee of the executive branch as defined
  2 20 in section 7E.2, other than a member or employee of the state
  2 21 board of regents and institutions under the control of the
  2 22 state board of regents.
  2 23    b.  For purposes of this section, "out=of=state travel" does
  2 24 not include out=of=state travel incidental to travel between a
  2 25 travel departure point in this state and a travel destination
  2 26 point in the city of Carter Lake.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    Division I of this bill concerns purchasing procedures under
  2 31 the department of administrative services. Current law permits
  2 32 a state agency, upon request and approval by the department
  2 33 of administrative services, to make a purchase of goods or
  2 34 services directly from a vendor, rather than purchasing through
  2 35 the department, if one of certain conditions is met. One of
  3  1 the conditions is if the purchase will not exceed $10,000 and
  3  2 the purchase would contribute to the agency complying with
  3  3 targeted small business procurement goals.
  3  4    The bill modifies that condition to permit a state agency
  3  5 to engage in direct purchasing for any purchase that will not
  3  6 exceed $25,000. The bill also strikes the requirement for
  3  7 a prior request and approval by the department for direct
  3  8 purchasing. The bill requires a state agency that makes such
  3  9 a purchase to promptly notify the department that it has done
  3 10 so. The bill provides that the notification must include
  3 11 documentation demonstrating that the purchase met the criteria
  3 12 for a direct purchase provided in the bill. The bill provides
  3 13 that prior notification of or approval by the department for
  3 14 such purchases shall not be required. The bill provides that
  3 15 competitive bidding shall not be required for such purchases.
  3 16 In addition, for a direct purchase of $25,000 or less that is
  3 17 not due to an immediate or emergency need, the state agency
  3 18 shall, if multiple bidders are practicable, solicit bids from
  3 19 at least three Iowa=based businesses and select the bid that
  3 20 best meets the needs of the state agency.
  3 21    The bill also provides that a state agency that meets the
  3 22 requirements for direct purchasing provided in the bill may
  3 23 engage in direct purchasing instead of purchasing pursuant to a
  3 24 master contract established by the department.
  3 25    Division II of the bill concerns claims for reimbursement of
  3 26 out=of=state travel by executive branch employees.  Current law
  3 27 requires the department of administrative services to develop
  3 28 and implement an electronic travel authorization form which
  3 29 shall be used by an executive branch employee when requesting
  3 30 reimbursement for out=of=state travel.  The bill strikes the
  3 31 requirement for development and use of the electronic travel
  3 32 form and instead provides that a claim for reimbursement shall
  3 33 be allowed upon the approval of the claim by the head of the
  3 34 employee's state agency.  The bill requires each state agency
  3 35 with authority to approve claims to establish a process for a
  4  1 detailed review of selected claims.

  3 16 In addition, for a direct purchase of $25,000 or less that is
  3 17 not due to an immediate or emergency need, the state agency
  3 18 shall, if multiple bidders are practicable, solicit bids from
  3 19 at least three Iowa=based businesses and select the bid that
  3 20 best meets the needs of the state agency.
  3 21    The bill also provides that a state agency that meets the
  3 22 requirements for direct purchasing provided in the bill may
  3 23 engage in direct purchasing instead of purchasing pursuant to a

  3 25    Division II of the bill concerns claims for reimbursement of
  3 26 out=of=state travel by executive branch employees.  Current law

  2  9    8A.512A  Executive branch employee travel.
  2 10    1.  A claim for reimbursement for any out=of=state travel,
  2 11 conference, or related expenditures of an executive branch
  2 12 employee associated with the employee's official duties shall
  2 13 be allowed upon the approval of the claim by the head of the

  2 15 approve claims under this section shall establish a process
  2 16 for a detailed review of claims selected by the department to
  2 17 determine the appropriateness of the claims for reimbursement.
  2 18    2.  a.  For purposes of this section, "executive branch
  2 19 employee" means an employee of the executive branch as defined
  2 20 in section 7E.2, other than a member or employee of the state
  2 21 board of regents and institutions under the control of the
  2 22 state board of regents.
  2 23    b.  For purposes of this section, "out=of=state travel" does
  2 24 not include out=of=state travel incidental to travel between a
  2 25 travel departure point in this state and a travel destination
  2 26 point in the city of Carter Lake.

  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    Division I of this bill concerns purchasing procedures under
  2 31 the department of administrative services. Current law permits
  2 32 a state agency, upon request and approval by the department
  2 33 of administrative services, to make a purchase of goods or
  2 34 services directly from a vendor, rather than purchasing through
  2 35 the department, if one of certain conditions is met. One of
  3  1 the conditions is if the purchase will not exceed $10,000 and
  3  2 the purchase would contribute to the agency complying with
  3  3 targeted small business procurement goals.
  3  4    The bill modifies that condition to permit a state agency
  3  5 to engage in direct purchasing for any purchase that will not
  3  6 exceed $25,000. The bill also strikes the requirement for
  3  7 a prior request and approval by the department for direct
  3  8 purchasing. The bill requires a state agency that makes such
  3  9 a purchase to promptly notify the department that it has done
  3 10 so. The bill provides that the notification must include
  3 11 documentation demonstrating that the purchase met the criteria
  3 12 for a direct purchase provided in the bill. The bill provides
  3 13 that prior notification of or approval by the department for
  3 14 such purchases shall not be required. The bill provides that
  3 15 competitive bidding shall not be required for such purchases.
  3 16 In addition, for a direct purchase of $25,000 or less that is

  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    Division I of this bill concerns purchasing procedures under
  2 31 the department of administrative services. Current law permits
  2 32 a state agency, upon request and approval by the department
  2 33 of administrative services, to make a purchase of goods or
  2 34 services directly from a vendor, rather than purchasing through
  2 35 the department, if one of certain conditions is met. One of
  3  1 the conditions is if the purchase will not exceed $10,000 and
  3  2 the purchase would contribute to the agency complying with
  3  3 targeted small business procurement goals.
  3  4    The bill modifies that condition to permit a state agency
  3  5 to engage in direct purchasing for any purchase that will not
  3  6 exceed $25,000. The bill also strikes the requirement for
  3  7 a prior request and approval by the department for direct
  3  8 purchasing. The bill requires a state agency that makes such
  3  9 a purchase to promptly notify the department that it has done
  3 10 so. The bill provides that the notification must include
  3 11 documentation demonstrating that the purchase met the criteria
  3 12 for a direct purchase provided in the bill. The bill provides
  3 13 that prior notification of or approval by the department for
  3 14 such purchases shall not be required. The bill provides that
  3 15 competitive bidding shall not be required for such purchases.
  3 16 In addition, for a direct purchase of $25,000 or less that is
  3 17 not due to an immediate or emergency need, the state agency
  3 18 shall, if multiple bidders are practicable, solicit bids from
  3 19 at least three Iowa=based businesses and select the bid that
  3 20 best meets the needs of the state agency.
  3 21    The bill also provides that a state agency that meets the
  3 22 requirements for direct purchasing provided in the bill may
  3 23 engage in direct purchasing instead of purchasing pursuant to a
  3 24 master contract established by the department.
  3 25    Division II of the bill concerns claims for reimbursement of
  3 26 out=of=state travel by executive branch employees.  Current law
  3 27 requires the department of administrative services to develop
  3 28 and implement an electronic travel authorization form which
  3 29 shall be used by an executive branch employee when requesting
  3 30 reimbursement for out=of=state travel.  The bill strikes the
  3 31 requirement for development and use of the electronic travel
  3 32 form and instead provides that a claim for reimbursement shall
  3 33 be allowed upon the approval of the claim by the head of the
  3 34 employee's state agency.  The bill requires each state agency
  3 35 with authority to approve claims to establish a process for a
  4  1 detailed review of selected claims.

  2 19 employee" means an employee of the executive branch as defined
  2 20 in section 7E.2, other than a member or employee of the state
  2 21 board of regents and institutions under the control of the
  2 22 state board of regents.
  2 23    b.  For purposes of this section, "out=of=state travel" does

  3 29 shall be used by an executive branch employee when requesting
  3 30 reimbursement for out=of=state travel.  The bill strikes the
  3 31 requirement for development and use of the electronic travel
  3 32 form and instead provides that a claim for reimbursement shall
  3 33 be allowed upon the approval of the claim by the head of the
  3 34 employee's state agency.  The bill requires each state agency
  3 35 with authority to approve claims to establish a process for a
