  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  8 29 FY 2018 ANNUAL REPORTS.  Each mental health and disability
  8 30 services region's annual report due to the department of human
  8 31 services on or before December 1, 2018, pursuant to section
  8 32 331.393, subsection 3, paragraph "a", shall include a plan
  8 33 that identifies milestones for meeting intensive mental health
  8 34 service requirements described in section 331.397, subsection
  8 35 5, no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan shall, at a minimum,
  9  1 include information relating to processes, implementation time
  9  2 frames, plans for collaboration with other regions and the
  9  3 Medicaid program, and the region's associated budget plan.
  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
  9 12 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
  9 13 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
  9 14 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
  9 15 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
  9 21 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
  9 23 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is

  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,

  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  8 32 331.393, subsection 3, paragraph "a", shall include a plan
  8 33 that identifies milestones for meeting intensive mental health
  8 34 service requirements described in section 331.397, subsection
  8 35 5, no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan shall, at a minimum,

  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
  9 12 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
  9 13 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
  9 14 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
  9 15 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
  9 21 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
  9 23 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective

  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,

  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
  9 23 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  8 35 5, no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan shall, at a minimum,
  9  1 include information relating to processes, implementation time
  9  2 frames, plans for collaboration with other regions and the
  9  3 Medicaid program, and the region's associated budget plan.
  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
  9 12 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
  9 13 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
  9 14 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
  9 15 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
  9 21 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
  9 23 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
  9 12 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
  9 13 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
  9 14 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
  9 15 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
  9 21 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
  9 23 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
  9 12 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
  9 13 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
  9 14 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
  9 15 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
  9 21 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
  9 23 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
  9 12 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
  9 13 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
  9 14 accordance with this section shall not take effect before

  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
  9 21 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as

  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated

  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
  9 12 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
  9 13 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
  9 14 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
  9 15 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
  9 21 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
  9 23 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9  4    Sec. 9.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized by
  9  5 a provision of this Act, the department of human services
  9  6 or the mental health and disability services commission may
  9  7 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
  9  8 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
  9  9 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
  9 10 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
  9 11 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is

  9 13 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
  9 14 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
  9 15 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
  9 16 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
  9 17 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
  9 18 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
  9 19 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
  9 20 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
  9 21 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
  9 22 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
  9 23 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt

 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under

 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced

 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on

 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning

  9 24                           EXPLANATION
  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different

 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,

 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.

  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan

 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.

  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional

 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning

  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan

 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided

 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core

 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided

 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

  9 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 27    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
  9 28 and funding.
  9 29    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
  9 30 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
  9 31 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.

  9 32 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
  9 33 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
  9 34 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional

 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the

 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes

 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The

 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state

 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion

 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for

 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt

 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core

 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different

 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting

 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

  9 35 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 10  1 services to submit written approval of the application based
 10  2 upon the process used by the department of human services
 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25

 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.

 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements

 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion

 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided

 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the

 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different

 10  3 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 10  4 department of human services from approving an application
 10  5 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 10  6 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 10  7 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 10  8 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in

 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,

 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also

 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the

 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning

 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

       hb/rh
 10  9 under Code chapter 135G.
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

       hb/rh
 10 10    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 10 12 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 10 11 services region is required to submit an annual report to the

 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 10 13 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 10 14 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 10 15 achieved.
 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt

 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of

 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements

 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for

 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced

 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on

 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual

 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 13 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 16    The bill provides each region shall additionally submit
 10 17 a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly report
 10 18 shall provide information on the accessibility of intensive
 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The
 10 28 department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 10 29 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 10 30 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 10 31    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 10 32 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 10 33 health and disability services region's core service domains
 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 11  1 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements

 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 10 19 mental health services and the progress the region has made
 10 20 in meeting the region's milestones for compliance with such
 10 21 service requirements using forms and procedures established by
 10 22 the department.  If a region fails to meet the milestones in
 10 23 the region's plan for compliance with such access requirements,
 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of
 10 25 correction to the department to address deficiencies in the
 10 26 region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's plan
 10 27 of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan. The

 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under

 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 11  4 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements

 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual

 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,

 10 24 the department shall require the region to submit a plan of

 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under

 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for

 11  5 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 11  6 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 11  9 the availability of mental health and disability services
 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 11 17 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.

 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also

 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the

 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash

 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different

 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting

 10 34 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 10 35 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under

 11  2 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 11  3 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically

 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal

 11 18 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 11 19 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal

 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion

 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to

 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also

 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the

 11  7    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 11  8 mental health and disability services commission relating to

 11 10 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 11 11 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 11 12 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 11 13 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 11 14    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 11 15 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 11 16 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in

 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion

 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management

 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the

 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also

 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 13 24 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt

 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the

 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash

 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the

 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash

 11 20 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 11 21 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 11 22 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 13 18 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.
 13 23    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,

 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the

 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning

 11 23 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 11 24 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 11 25 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 11 26 standards for such services.
 11 27    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 11 28 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 11 29 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 11 30 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 11 31 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 11 32 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 11 33 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 11 34 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 11 35 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 12  1 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 12  2 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 12  3 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 12  4 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 12  5 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 12  6 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 12  7 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 12  8 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 12  9 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 12 10 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 12 11 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 12 12 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 12 21 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 12 22 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 12 23 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 12 24 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 12 25 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 12 26 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 12 27 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 12 28 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 12 29 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 12 30 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 12 31 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 12 32 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 12 33 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 12 34 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 12 35 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 13  1 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 13  2 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 13  3 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 13  4 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 13  5    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 13  6 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 13  7 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 13  8 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 13  9 under the new region's regional service system management
 13 10 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 13 11 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 13 12 multiplied by the county's population.
 13 13    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 13 14 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 13 15 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 13 16 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 13 17 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code

 13 19 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 13 20 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 13 21 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 13 22 budget plan.

 12 13 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 12 14 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 12 15 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 12 16 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 12 17 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 12 18 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 12 19 population of the region.
 12 20    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
