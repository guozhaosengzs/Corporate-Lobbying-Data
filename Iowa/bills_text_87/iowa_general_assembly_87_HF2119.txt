  1 10 importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  1 11                           EXPLANATION
  1 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 14    GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal Agriculture
  1 15 Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which generally authorizes
  1 16 the department of natural resources (DNR) to regulate
  1 17 confinement feeding operations (operations) including
  1 18 associated confinement feeding operation structures
  1 19 (structures) and the use of manure originating from the
  1 20 operation (e.g., by application on agricultural land).  The
  1 21 bill amends provisions that assign an equivalency factor to
  1 22 fishes for purposes of calculating the operation's animal unit
  1 23 capacity (AUC).
  1 24    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that when calculating
  1 25 an operation's AUC, a fish weighing less than 25 grams is
  1 26 assigned a new equivalency factor of 0.00006.  A fish weighing
  1 27 25 grams or more retains its current assigned equivalency
  1 28 factor of 0.001.
  1 29    BACKGROUND.  An operation includes a totally roofed building
  1 30 where certain confined agricultural animals are maintained
  1 31 in a structure such as a confinement building for 45 days
  1 32 or more during any 12=month period (Code section 459.102).
  1 33 Relevant regulations include both air quality requirements
  1 34 (e.g., separation distances between a structure or the location
  1 35 where manure is applied and a benefited object or location
  2  1 such as a residence) and water quality requirements (e.g.,
  2  2 the issuance of a construction permit and the approval of a
  2  3 manure management plan).  Generally, these regulations apply
  2  4 differently to structures depending on the operation's size,
  2  5 determined by calculating its AUC (the maximum number of animal
  2  6 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any
  2  7 one time).  Each category of animal is assigned an equivalency
  2  8 factor and a category may be subdivided into subcategories
  2  9 based on the animal's weight.  The equivalency factor for each
  2 10 category or subcategory is multiplied by the number of head
  2 11 maintained as part of the operation.
  2 12    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  A person who violates a
  2 13 regulation provided in the Code chapter is subject to a civil
  2 14 penalty depending upon the type of violation.  For an air
  2 15 quality violation, the enforcement action is conducted by
  2 16 DNR as part of an administrative hearing and the person is
  2 17 subject to a range of civil penalties not to exceed $10,000
  2 18 (Code section 459.602 referring to Code section 455B.109).
  2 19 For a water quality violation, the enforcement action may be
  2 20 conducted by DNR in the same manner as an air quality violation
  2 21 or it may be conducted by the attorney general as part of a
  2 22 court hearing and in that case the person is generally subject
  2 23 to a civil penalty that cannot exceed $5,000 (Code section
  2 24 459.603 referring to Code sections 455B.109 and 455B.191).
  2 25    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  2 26 enactment.

  1 14    GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal Agriculture
  1 15 Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which generally authorizes
  1 16 the department of natural resources (DNR) to regulate
  1 17 confinement feeding operations (operations) including
  1 18 associated confinement feeding operation structures
  1 19 (structures) and the use of manure originating from the
  1 20 operation (e.g., by application on agricultural land).  The
  1 21 bill amends provisions that assign an equivalency factor to
  1 22 fishes for purposes of calculating the operation's animal unit
  1 23 capacity (AUC).
  1 24    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that when calculating
  1 25 an operation's AUC, a fish weighing less than 25 grams is
  1 26 assigned a new equivalency factor of 0.00006.  A fish weighing
  1 27 25 grams or more retains its current assigned equivalency
  1 28 factor of 0.001.
  1 29    BACKGROUND.  An operation includes a totally roofed building
  1 30 where certain confined agricultural animals are maintained
  1 31 in a structure such as a confinement building for 45 days
  1 32 or more during any 12=month period (Code section 459.102).
  1 33 Relevant regulations include both air quality requirements
  1 34 (e.g., separation distances between a structure or the location
  1 35 where manure is applied and a benefited object or location
  2  1 such as a residence) and water quality requirements (e.g.,

  1 24    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  The bill provides that when calculating
  1 25 an operation's AUC, a fish weighing less than 25 grams is
  1 26 assigned a new equivalency factor of 0.00006.  A fish weighing
  1 27 25 grams or more retains its current assigned equivalency
  1 28 factor of 0.001.
  1 29    BACKGROUND.  An operation includes a totally roofed building
  1 30 where certain confined agricultural animals are maintained
  1 31 in a structure such as a confinement building for 45 days
  1 32 or more during any 12=month period (Code section 459.102).
  1 33 Relevant regulations include both air quality requirements
  1 34 (e.g., separation distances between a structure or the location
  1 35 where manure is applied and a benefited object or location
  2  1 such as a residence) and water quality requirements (e.g.,
  2  2 the issuance of a construction permit and the approval of a
  2  3 manure management plan).  Generally, these regulations apply
  2  4 differently to structures depending on the operation's size,
  2  5 determined by calculating its AUC (the maximum number of animal
  2  6 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any
  2  7 one time).  Each category of animal is assigned an equivalency
  2  8 factor and a category may be subdivided into subcategories
  2  9 based on the animal's weight.  The equivalency factor for each
  2 10 category or subcategory is multiplied by the number of head
  2 11 maintained as part of the operation.
  2 12    APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.  A person who violates a
  2 13 regulation provided in the Code chapter is subject to a civil
  2 14 penalty depending upon the type of violation.  For an air
  2 15 quality violation, the enforcement action is conducted by
  2 16 DNR as part of an administrative hearing and the person is
  2 17 subject to a range of civil penalties not to exceed $10,000
  2 18 (Code section 459.602 referring to Code section 455B.109).
  2 19 For a water quality violation, the enforcement action may be
  2 20 conducted by DNR in the same manner as an air quality violation
  2 21 or it may be conducted by the attorney general as part of a
  2 22 court hearing and in that case the person is generally subject
  2 23 to a civil penalty that cannot exceed $5,000 (Code section
  2 24 459.603 referring to Code sections 455B.109 and 455B.191).
