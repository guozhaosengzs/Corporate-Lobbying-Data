  5  7                           EXPLANATION
  5  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  5 11 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in large
  5 12 part regulates confinement feeding operations (operations)
  5 13 including associated confinement feeding operation structures
  5 14 (structures).  The bill creates a new category of operation
  5 15 referred to as a small confinement feeding operation that would
  5 16 in part replace a current category referred to as a small
  5 17 animal feeding operation currently exempt from separation
  5 18 distance requirements existing between a benefited object or
  5 19 location and an associated structure.
  5 20    BILL'S PROVISIONS == REQUIRED SEPARATION DISTANCES UNDER
  5 21 CURRENT LAW AND AS REVISED BY THE BILL.  Generally, Code
  5 22 chapter 459, subchapter II regulates air quality by requiring a
  5 23 number of separation distances between a benefited object or
  5 24 location and both: (1) an operation's structure (Code sections
  5 25 459.202 and 459.203) and (2) the place where manure is used
  5 26 when removed from a structure, including for land application
  5 27 if the manure is liquid (Code section 459.204) or for temporary
  5 28 stockpiling if the manure is solid (Code section 459.204B).
  5 29 Under the bill, a small animal feeding operation existing
  5 30 prior to the bill's effective date would continue to be
  5 31 exempt from separation distance requirements but could expand
  5 32 only under certain circumstances:  (1) it could not involve
  5 33 the construction or expansion of an unformed manure storage
  5 34 structure, but could involve the replacement of such structure
  5 35 with a formed manure storage structure, and (2) it would have
  6  1 to comply with the separation distance requirement otherwise
  6  2 applicable to the same kind of structure that is part of an
  6  3 operation that was not exempted (New Code section 459.203A).
  6  4    BACKGROUND == SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The
  6  5 separation distance required between a benefited object or
  6  6 location and an operation's structure is contingent upon
  6  7 several criteria: first, when the operation's structure was
  6  8 constructed or expanded, and second, the operation's size as
  6  9 determined by calculating its confined animal capacity which
  6 10 is either its animal weight capacity or animal unit capacity
  6 11 (AUC).
  6 12    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  An operation includes a totally
  6 13 roofed building where certain confined agricultural animals
  6 14 are maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  6 15 An operation's structure includes a building, egg washwater
  6 16 storage structure, or one of two types of manure storage
  6 17 structures: formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls
  6 18 and a floor constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  6 19 as compared to an unformed structure such as an anaerobic
  6 20 lagoon.  The Code chapter also refers to a number of different
  6 21 types of benefited objects or locations including a residence
  6 22 (home), religious institution (e.g., a church), educational
  6 23 institution (e.g., a public or nonpublic school),  commercial
  6 24 enterprise (e.g., a business other than a farm), public
  6 25 thoroughfare (e.g., road), or a public use area (e.g., a park
  6 26 or cemetery). AUC calculates the maximum number of animal
  6 27 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any one
  6 28 time.  A small animal feeding operation has a maximum=size AUC
  6 29 of 500 animal units. A small confinement feeding operation has
  6 30 a maximum size of 300 animal units.
  6 31    BACKGROUND == CALCULATING ACU.  In calculating an
  6 32 operation's ACU, each of various types of confined agricultural
  6 33 animals is assigned a special equivalency factor.  For example,
  6 34 each sheep or lamb has an equivalency factor of 0.10 animal
  6 35 units (Code section 459.102). In order to qualify as a small
  7  1 animal feeding operation, an operation must have a maximum AUC
  7  2 of not more than 5,000 of such animals (500 ? 0.10 = 5,000).
  7  3 Under the bill, that maximum ACU would be reduced to 3,000
  7  4 animals (300 ? 0.10 = 3,000).

  5 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  5 11 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in large
  5 12 part regulates confinement feeding operations (operations)
  5 13 including associated confinement feeding operation structures
  5 14 (structures).  The bill creates a new category of operation
  5 15 referred to as a small confinement feeding operation that would
  5 16 in part replace a current category referred to as a small
  5 17 animal feeding operation currently exempt from separation
  5 18 distance requirements existing between a benefited object or
  5 19 location and an associated structure.
  5 20    BILL'S PROVISIONS == REQUIRED SEPARATION DISTANCES UNDER
  5 21 CURRENT LAW AND AS REVISED BY THE BILL.  Generally, Code
  5 22 chapter 459, subchapter II regulates air quality by requiring a
  5 23 number of separation distances between a benefited object or
  5 24 location and both: (1) an operation's structure (Code sections
  5 25 459.202 and 459.203) and (2) the place where manure is used
  5 26 when removed from a structure, including for land application
  5 27 if the manure is liquid (Code section 459.204) or for temporary
  5 28 stockpiling if the manure is solid (Code section 459.204B).
  5 29 Under the bill, a small animal feeding operation existing
  5 30 prior to the bill's effective date would continue to be
  5 31 exempt from separation distance requirements but could expand
  5 32 only under certain circumstances:  (1) it could not involve
  5 33 the construction or expansion of an unformed manure storage
  5 34 structure, but could involve the replacement of such structure
  5 35 with a formed manure storage structure, and (2) it would have
  6  1 to comply with the separation distance requirement otherwise

  6 25 thoroughfare (e.g., road), or a public use area (e.g., a park
  6 26 or cemetery). AUC calculates the maximum number of animal
  6 27 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any one

  6 26 or cemetery). AUC calculates the maximum number of animal
  6 27 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any one
  6 28 time.  A small animal feeding operation has a maximum=size AUC
  6 29 of 500 animal units. A small confinement feeding operation has
  6 30 a maximum size of 300 animal units.
  6 31    BACKGROUND == CALCULATING ACU.  In calculating an
  6 32 operation's ACU, each of various types of confined agricultural
  6 33 animals is assigned a special equivalency factor.  For example,
  6 34 each sheep or lamb has an equivalency factor of 0.10 animal
  6 35 units (Code section 459.102). In order to qualify as a small
  7  1 animal feeding operation, an operation must have a maximum AUC
  7  2 of not more than 5,000 of such animals (500 ? 0.10 = 5,000).
  7  3 Under the bill, that maximum ACU would be reduced to 3,000
  7  4 animals (300 ? 0.10 = 3,000).

  5 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  5 11 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in large
  5 12 part regulates confinement feeding operations (operations)
  5 13 including associated confinement feeding operation structures
  5 14 (structures).  The bill creates a new category of operation
  5 15 referred to as a small confinement feeding operation that would
  5 16 in part replace a current category referred to as a small
  5 17 animal feeding operation currently exempt from separation
  5 18 distance requirements existing between a benefited object or
  5 19 location and an associated structure.
  5 20    BILL'S PROVISIONS == REQUIRED SEPARATION DISTANCES UNDER
  5 21 CURRENT LAW AND AS REVISED BY THE BILL.  Generally, Code
  5 22 chapter 459, subchapter II regulates air quality by requiring a
  5 23 number of separation distances between a benefited object or
  5 24 location and both: (1) an operation's structure (Code sections
  5 25 459.202 and 459.203) and (2) the place where manure is used
  5 26 when removed from a structure, including for land application
  5 27 if the manure is liquid (Code section 459.204) or for temporary
  5 28 stockpiling if the manure is solid (Code section 459.204B).
  5 29 Under the bill, a small animal feeding operation existing
  5 30 prior to the bill's effective date would continue to be
  5 31 exempt from separation distance requirements but could expand
  5 32 only under certain circumstances:  (1) it could not involve
  5 33 the construction or expansion of an unformed manure storage
  5 34 structure, but could involve the replacement of such structure
  5 35 with a formed manure storage structure, and (2) it would have
  6  1 to comply with the separation distance requirement otherwise
  6  2 applicable to the same kind of structure that is part of an
  6  3 operation that was not exempted (New Code section 459.203A).
  6  4    BACKGROUND == SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The
  6  5 separation distance required between a benefited object or
  6  6 location and an operation's structure is contingent upon
  6  7 several criteria: first, when the operation's structure was
  6  8 constructed or expanded, and second, the operation's size as
  6  9 determined by calculating its confined animal capacity which
  6 10 is either its animal weight capacity or animal unit capacity
  6 11 (AUC).
  6 12    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  An operation includes a totally
  6 13 roofed building where certain confined agricultural animals
  6 14 are maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  6 15 An operation's structure includes a building, egg washwater
  6 16 storage structure, or one of two types of manure storage
  6 17 structures: formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls
  6 18 and a floor constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  6 19 as compared to an unformed structure such as an anaerobic
  6 20 lagoon.  The Code chapter also refers to a number of different
  6 21 types of benefited objects or locations including a residence
  6 22 (home), religious institution (e.g., a church), educational
  6 23 institution (e.g., a public or nonpublic school),  commercial
  6 24 enterprise (e.g., a business other than a farm), public
  6 25 thoroughfare (e.g., road), or a public use area (e.g., a park
  6 26 or cemetery). AUC calculates the maximum number of animal
  6 27 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any one

  6  9 determined by calculating its confined animal capacity which
  6 10 is either its animal weight capacity or animal unit capacity
  6 11 (AUC).
  6 12    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  An operation includes a totally
  6 13 roofed building where certain confined agricultural animals
  6 14 are maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  6 15 An operation's structure includes a building, egg washwater
  6 16 storage structure, or one of two types of manure storage
  6 17 structures: formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls
  6 18 and a floor constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  6 19 as compared to an unformed structure such as an anaerobic
  6 20 lagoon.  The Code chapter also refers to a number of different
  6 21 types of benefited objects or locations including a residence
  6 22 (home), religious institution (e.g., a church), educational
  6 23 institution (e.g., a public or nonpublic school),  commercial
  6 24 enterprise (e.g., a business other than a farm), public
  6 25 thoroughfare (e.g., road), or a public use area (e.g., a park
  6 26 or cemetery). AUC calculates the maximum number of animal
  6 27 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any one
  6 28 time.  A small animal feeding operation has a maximum=size AUC
  6 29 of 500 animal units. A small confinement feeding operation has
  6 30 a maximum size of 300 animal units.
  6 31    BACKGROUND == CALCULATING ACU.  In calculating an
  6 32 operation's ACU, each of various types of confined agricultural
  6 33 animals is assigned a special equivalency factor.  For example,
  6 34 each sheep or lamb has an equivalency factor of 0.10 animal
  6 35 units (Code section 459.102). In order to qualify as a small
  7  1 animal feeding operation, an operation must have a maximum AUC
  7  2 of not more than 5,000 of such animals (500 ? 0.10 = 5,000).
  7  3 Under the bill, that maximum ACU would be reduced to 3,000
  7  4 animals (300 ? 0.10 = 3,000).

  6 26 or cemetery). AUC calculates the maximum number of animal
  6 27 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any one
  6 28 time.  A small animal feeding operation has a maximum=size AUC
  6 29 of 500 animal units. A small confinement feeding operation has
  6 30 a maximum size of 300 animal units.
  6 31    BACKGROUND == CALCULATING ACU.  In calculating an
  6 32 operation's ACU, each of various types of confined agricultural
  6 33 animals is assigned a special equivalency factor.  For example,
  6 34 each sheep or lamb has an equivalency factor of 0.10 animal
  6 35 units (Code section 459.102). In order to qualify as a small
  7  1 animal feeding operation, an operation must have a maximum AUC
  7  2 of not more than 5,000 of such animals (500 ? 0.10 = 5,000).
  7  3 Under the bill, that maximum ACU would be reduced to 3,000
  7  4 animals (300 ? 0.10 = 3,000).

  5 20    BILL'S PROVISIONS == REQUIRED SEPARATION DISTANCES UNDER
  5 21 CURRENT LAW AND AS REVISED BY THE BILL.  Generally, Code
  5 22 chapter 459, subchapter II regulates air quality by requiring a
  5 23 number of separation distances between a benefited object or
  5 24 location and both: (1) an operation's structure (Code sections
  5 25 459.202 and 459.203) and (2) the place where manure is used
  5 26 when removed from a structure, including for land application
  5 27 if the manure is liquid (Code section 459.204) or for temporary
  5 28 stockpiling if the manure is solid (Code section 459.204B).
  5 29 Under the bill, a small animal feeding operation existing
  5 30 prior to the bill's effective date would continue to be
  5 31 exempt from separation distance requirements but could expand
  5 32 only under certain circumstances:  (1) it could not involve
  5 33 the construction or expansion of an unformed manure storage
  5 34 structure, but could involve the replacement of such structure
  5 35 with a formed manure storage structure, and (2) it would have
  6  1 to comply with the separation distance requirement otherwise
  6  2 applicable to the same kind of structure that is part of an
  6  3 operation that was not exempted (New Code section 459.203A).
  6  4    BACKGROUND == SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The
  6  5 separation distance required between a benefited object or
  6  6 location and an operation's structure is contingent upon
  6  7 several criteria: first, when the operation's structure was
  6  8 constructed or expanded, and second, the operation's size as
  6  9 determined by calculating its confined animal capacity which
  6 10 is either its animal weight capacity or animal unit capacity
  6 11 (AUC).
  6 12    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  An operation includes a totally
  6 13 roofed building where certain confined agricultural animals
  6 14 are maintained for 45 days or more in any 12=month period.
  6 15 An operation's structure includes a building, egg washwater
  6 16 storage structure, or one of two types of manure storage
  6 17 structures: formed or unformed.  A formed structure has walls
  6 18 and a floor constructed of durable materials such as concrete
  6 19 as compared to an unformed structure such as an anaerobic
  6 20 lagoon.  The Code chapter also refers to a number of different
  6 21 types of benefited objects or locations including a residence
  6 22 (home), religious institution (e.g., a church), educational
  6 23 institution (e.g., a public or nonpublic school),  commercial
  6 24 enterprise (e.g., a business other than a farm), public
  6 25 thoroughfare (e.g., road), or a public use area (e.g., a park

  6 24 enterprise (e.g., a business other than a farm), public
  6 25 thoroughfare (e.g., road), or a public use area (e.g., a park

  6 27 units that may be maintained as part of an operation at any one

  6 29 of 500 animal units. A small confinement feeding operation has
  6 30 a maximum size of 300 animal units.
  6 31    BACKGROUND == CALCULATING ACU.  In calculating an
  6 32 operation's ACU, each of various types of confined agricultural
  6 33 animals is assigned a special equivalency factor.  For example,
  6 34 each sheep or lamb has an equivalency factor of 0.10 animal
  6 35 units (Code section 459.102). In order to qualify as a small
  7  1 animal feeding operation, an operation must have a maximum AUC
  7  2 of not more than 5,000 of such animals (500 ? 0.10 = 5,000).
  7  3 Under the bill, that maximum ACU would be reduced to 3,000
  7  4 animals (300 ? 0.10 = 3,000).

  6 33 animals is assigned a special equivalency factor.  For example,
  6 34 each sheep or lamb has an equivalency factor of 0.10 animal
  6 35 units (Code section 459.102). In order to qualify as a small
  7  1 animal feeding operation, an operation must have a maximum AUC
  7  2 of not more than 5,000 of such animals (500 ? 0.10 = 5,000).
  7  3 Under the bill, that maximum ACU would be reduced to 3,000
  7  4 animals (300 ? 0.10 = 3,000).
