  4 35    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  5  1 demonstration pilot projects for a three=year renewable period
  5  2 by clusters of attendance centers within a school district if
  5  3 approved by the department of education.
  5  4    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  5  5 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  5  6 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each
  5  7 pilot project is comprised of a cluster within the school
  5  8 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  5  9 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  5 10 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5 11    The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the

  5 25 withdraws its approval, waivers and exceptions granted for
  5 26 purposes of the pilot project are revoked.
  5 27    PILOT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.  The bill lists the requirements
  5 28 each pilot project must meet, including but not limited
  5 29 to multiple career paths for teachers; expanded roles
  5 30 for teachers; market=based compensation for teachers;
  5 31 performance=based accountability of teachers that includes

  5 33 teaching contracts; a system for teacher hiring and advancement
  5 34 based on peer evaluation; ongoing professional development
  5 35 activities; and a formal teacher mentoring system.
  6  1 The pilot project must also establish an alternative
  6  2 preparation program to train and hire an individual who
  6  3 possesses, at a minimum, a baccalaureate degree in the field in
  6  4 which the individual will be employed to provide instruction
  6  5 as a teacher at an attendance center in the cluster.  The bill
  6  6 nullifies the practitioner preparation program provisions of
  6  7 Code section 256.7, subsection 3, and the provisions of Code
  6  8 chapter 272, for purposes of this pilot project requirement.
  6  9 Such individuals must also be provided with opportunities

  6 27 and due process requirements and provisions of Code chapter 279
  6 28 do not apply to teachers and administrators in a pilot project,
  6 29 and any collective bargaining provision that is inconsistent
  6 30 with any compensation, evaluation, and performance=based
  6 31 accountability requirement of a teacher quality demonstration
  6 32 pilot project is deemed void and unenforceable.
  6 33    EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS ==== REPORT.  The department and
  6 34 each school district operating an approved pilot project must
  6 35 regularly evaluate and document the activities and approaches
  7  1 utilized and outcomes achieved under a pilot project. The

  6 29 and any collective bargaining provision that is inconsistent
  6 30 with any compensation, evaluation, and performance=based
  6 31 accountability requirement of a teacher quality demonstration
  6 32 pilot project is deemed void and unenforceable.
  6 33    EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS ==== REPORT.  The department and

  4 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 35    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  5  1 demonstration pilot projects for a three=year renewable period
  5  2 by clusters of attendance centers within a school district if

  5  4    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  5  5 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  5  6 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each

  5  8 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  5  9 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  5 10 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5 11    The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the

  5 25 withdraws its approval, waivers and exceptions granted for
  5 26 purposes of the pilot project are revoked.
  5 27    PILOT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.  The bill lists the requirements
  5 28 each pilot project must meet, including but not limited
  5 29 to multiple career paths for teachers; expanded roles
  5 30 for teachers; market=based compensation for teachers;

  6  3 possesses, at a minimum, a baccalaureate degree in the field in
  6  4 which the individual will be employed to provide instruction
  6  5 as a teacher at an attendance center in the cluster.  The bill
  6  6 nullifies the practitioner preparation program provisions of

  6 27 and due process requirements and provisions of Code chapter 279
  6 28 do not apply to teachers and administrators in a pilot project,
  6 29 and any collective bargaining provision that is inconsistent
  6 30 with any compensation, evaluation, and performance=based
  6 31 accountability requirement of a teacher quality demonstration
  6 32 pilot project is deemed void and unenforceable.
  6 33    EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS ==== REPORT.  The department and
  6 34 each school district operating an approved pilot project must
  6 35 regularly evaluate and document the activities and approaches
  7  1 utilized and outcomes achieved under a pilot project. The

  4 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 35    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  5  1 demonstration pilot projects for a three=year renewable period
  5  2 by clusters of attendance centers within a school district if
  5  3 approved by the department of education.
  5  4    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  5  5 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  5  6 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each
  5  7 pilot project is comprised of a cluster within the school
  5  8 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  5  9 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  5 10 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5 11    The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the
  5 12 instructional staff who may or may not be licensed under Code
  5 13 chapter 272 and who is employed by the school district to
  5 14 provide instruction in the cluster on a part=time or full=time
  5 15 basis.
  5 16    The department must make information regarding teacher
  5 17 quality demonstration pilot project requirements and the
  5 18 pilot project application and review process available on its
  5 19 internet site;  must approve applications for the creation
  5 20 of between 5 and 12 pilot projects; and must review each
  5 21 pilot project annually based on the data submitted in the
  5 22 school district's comprehensive school improvement plan.
  5 23 The department may withdraw approval of a pilot project for
  5 24 failure to meet pilot project requirements.  If the department
  5 25 withdraws its approval, waivers and exceptions granted for
  5 26 purposes of the pilot project are revoked.
  5 27    PILOT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.  The bill lists the requirements
  5 28 each pilot project must meet, including but not limited
  5 29 to multiple career paths for teachers; expanded roles
  5 30 for teachers; market=based compensation for teachers;
  5 31 performance=based accountability of teachers that includes
  5 32 elimination of teacher tenure and establishment of three=year
  5 33 teaching contracts; a system for teacher hiring and advancement
  5 34 based on peer evaluation; ongoing professional development
  5 35 activities; and a formal teacher mentoring system.
  6  1 The pilot project must also establish an alternative
  6  2 preparation program to train and hire an individual who
  6  3 possesses, at a minimum, a baccalaureate degree in the field in
  6  4 which the individual will be employed to provide instruction
  6  5 as a teacher at an attendance center in the cluster.  The bill
  6  6 nullifies the practitioner preparation program provisions of
  6  7 Code section 256.7, subsection 3, and the provisions of Code
  6  8 chapter 272, for purposes of this pilot project requirement.
  6  9 Such individuals must also be provided with opportunities

  6 23 and a description of the statutes and rules requirements and
  6 24 provisions that the department is requested to waive.
  6 25    INAPPLICABILITY OF STATUTES ==== AGREEMENT PROVISIONS VOID.
  6 26  The bill provides that the probation, evaluation, employment,
  6 27 and due process requirements and provisions of Code chapter 279
  6 28 do not apply to teachers and administrators in a pilot project,
  6 29 and any collective bargaining provision that is inconsistent
  6 30 with any compensation, evaluation, and performance=based
  6 31 accountability requirement of a teacher quality demonstration
  6 32 pilot project is deemed void and unenforceable.
  6 33    EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS ==== REPORT.  The department and
  6 34 each school district operating an approved pilot project must
  6 35 regularly evaluate and document the activities and approaches
  7  1 utilized and outcomes achieved under a pilot project. The

  4 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 35    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  5  1 demonstration pilot projects for a three=year renewable period
  5  2 by clusters of attendance centers within a school district if

  5  4    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  5  5 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  5  6 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each
  5  7 pilot project is comprised of a cluster within the school
  5  8 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  5  9 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  5 10 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5 11    The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the

  6  3 possesses, at a minimum, a baccalaureate degree in the field in
  6  4 which the individual will be employed to provide instruction
  6  5 as a teacher at an attendance center in the cluster.  The bill

  6 27 and due process requirements and provisions of Code chapter 279
  6 28 do not apply to teachers and administrators in a pilot project,
  6 29 and any collective bargaining provision that is inconsistent
  6 30 with any compensation, evaluation, and performance=based
  6 31 accountability requirement of a teacher quality demonstration
  6 32 pilot project is deemed void and unenforceable.
  6 33    EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS ==== REPORT.  The department and
  6 34 each school district operating an approved pilot project must
  6 35 regularly evaluate and document the activities and approaches
  7  1 utilized and outcomes achieved under a pilot project. The

  4 35    This bill relates to the establishment of teacher quality
  5  1 demonstration pilot projects for a three=year renewable period
  5  2 by clusters of attendance centers within a school district if
  5  3 approved by the department of education.
  5  4    GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Only the school district's
  5  5 superintendent may apply to the department for approval to
  5  6 operate a teacher quality demonstration pilot project.  Each
  5  7 pilot project is comprised of a cluster within the school
  5  8 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  5  9 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  5 10 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5 11    The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the
  5 12 instructional staff who may or may not be licensed under Code
  5 13 chapter 272 and who is employed by the school district to
  5 14 provide instruction in the cluster on a part=time or full=time
  5 15 basis.

  5 25 withdraws its approval, waivers and exceptions granted for
  5 26 purposes of the pilot project are revoked.
  5 27    PILOT PROJECT REQUIREMENTS.  The bill lists the requirements
  5 28 each pilot project must meet, including but not limited
  5 29 to multiple career paths for teachers; expanded roles
  5 30 for teachers; market=based compensation for teachers;
  5 31 performance=based accountability of teachers that includes
  5 32 elimination of teacher tenure and establishment of three=year
  5 33 teaching contracts; a system for teacher hiring and advancement
  5 34 based on peer evaluation; ongoing professional development
  5 35 activities; and a formal teacher mentoring system.
  6  1 The pilot project must also establish an alternative
  6  2 preparation program to train and hire an individual who
  6  3 possesses, at a minimum, a baccalaureate degree in the field in
  6  4 which the individual will be employed to provide instruction
  6  5 as a teacher at an attendance center in the cluster.  The bill
  6  6 nullifies the practitioner preparation program provisions of
  6  7 Code section 256.7, subsection 3, and the provisions of Code
  6  8 chapter 272, for purposes of this pilot project requirement.
  6  9 Such individuals must also be provided with opportunities
  6 10 to meet the requirements for a teaching license under Code
  6 11 chapter 272 or to become certified by the national board for
  6 12 professional teaching standards.

  6 23 and a description of the statutes and rules requirements and
  6 24 provisions that the department is requested to waive.
  6 25    INAPPLICABILITY OF STATUTES ==== AGREEMENT PROVISIONS VOID.
  6 26  The bill provides that the probation, evaluation, employment,
  6 27 and due process requirements and provisions of Code chapter 279
  6 28 do not apply to teachers and administrators in a pilot project,
  6 29 and any collective bargaining provision that is inconsistent
  6 30 with any compensation, evaluation, and performance=based
  6 31 accountability requirement of a teacher quality demonstration
  6 32 pilot project is deemed void and unenforceable.
  6 33    EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS ==== REPORT.  The department and
  6 34 each school district operating an approved pilot project must
  6 35 regularly evaluate and document the activities and approaches
  7  1 utilized and outcomes achieved under a pilot project. The

  5  8 district.  Each cluster must include not less than one high
  5  9 school, not more than four middle schools, and not more than
  5 10 seven elementary schools in a given school district.
  5 11    The bill defines "teacher" to mean a member of the

  6  3 possesses, at a minimum, a baccalaureate degree in the field in
  6  4 which the individual will be employed to provide instruction
  6  5 as a teacher at an attendance center in the cluster.  The bill
  6  6 nullifies the practitioner preparation program provisions of

  6 27 and due process requirements and provisions of Code chapter 279
  6 28 do not apply to teachers and administrators in a pilot project,
  6 29 and any collective bargaining provision that is inconsistent
  6 30 with any compensation, evaluation, and performance=based
  6 31 accountability requirement of a teacher quality demonstration
  6 32 pilot project is deemed void and unenforceable.
  6 33    EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS ==== REPORT.  The department and
