  2  6 has completed an evaluation of the application prior to the

  2  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 11    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== GENERAL.  This bill amends the
  2 12 "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which
  2 13 generally regulates confinement feeding operations (operations)
  2 14 including associated confinement feeding operation structures
  2 15 (structures) by the department of natural resources (DNR).  The
  2 16 bill provides that the master matrix (matrix) used to evaluate
  2 17 an application to construct a structure must be comprised of
  2 18 three categories used to assess its impact on air quality,
  2 19 water quality, and the neighboring community.  It also provides
  2 20 that an application must achieve a minimum threshold score of
  2 21 70 percent of all points possible for each category in order to
  2 22 be recommended for approval by a county board of supervisors
  2 23 (board) to DNR.  The bill's provisions do not apply, if a board
  2 24 recommended approval or disapproval of an application, or DNR
  2 25 approved or disapproved an application, on the basis of an
  2 26 evaluation completed prior to the effective date of the bill
  2 27 using the matrix as it existed at that time.
  2 28    BACKGROUND == USE OF THE MATRIX.  The purpose of the matrix
  2 29 is to produce a statistically verifiable basis for determining
  2 30 whether to approve or disapprove an application (Code section
  2 31 459.305).  A person preparing to construct a structure that
  2 32 is an unformed manure storage structure or a structure that
  2 33 is part of an operation of a certain size (at least 1,000
  2 34 animal units) must obtain a permit by DNR (Code section
  2 35 459.303).  As part of the permit review process, a board
  3  1 that has filed a construction evaluation resolution with DNR
  3  2 (Code section 459.304) may make a recommendation based on the
  3  3 results of completing the matrix.   In those circumstances, DNR
  3  4 is also required to conduct an independent evaluation of the
  3  5 application using the matrix.
  3  6    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  3  7 enactment.

  2 11    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== GENERAL.  This bill amends the
  2 12 "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which
  2 13 generally regulates confinement feeding operations (operations)
  2 14 including associated confinement feeding operation structures
  2 15 (structures) by the department of natural resources (DNR).  The
  2 16 bill provides that the master matrix (matrix) used to evaluate
  2 17 an application to construct a structure must be comprised of
  2 18 three categories used to assess its impact on air quality,
  2 19 water quality, and the neighboring community.  It also provides
  2 20 that an application must achieve a minimum threshold score of
  2 21 70 percent of all points possible for each category in order to
  2 22 be recommended for approval by a county board of supervisors
  2 23 (board) to DNR.  The bill's provisions do not apply, if a board
  2 24 recommended approval or disapproval of an application, or DNR
  2 25 approved or disapproved an application, on the basis of an
  2 26 evaluation completed prior to the effective date of the bill
  2 27 using the matrix as it existed at that time.
  2 28    BACKGROUND == USE OF THE MATRIX.  The purpose of the matrix
  2 29 is to produce a statistically verifiable basis for determining
  2 30 whether to approve or disapprove an application (Code section
  2 31 459.305).  A person preparing to construct a structure that
  2 32 is an unformed manure storage structure or a structure that
  2 33 is part of an operation of a certain size (at least 1,000
  2 34 animal units) must obtain a permit by DNR (Code section
  2 35 459.303).  As part of the permit review process, a board
  3  1 that has filed a construction evaluation resolution with DNR
  3  2 (Code section 459.304) may make a recommendation based on the
  3  3 results of completing the matrix.   In those circumstances, DNR
  3  4 is also required to conduct an independent evaluation of the
  3  5 application using the matrix.

  2  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 11    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== GENERAL.  This bill amends the
  2 12 "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which
  2 13 generally regulates confinement feeding operations (operations)
  2 14 including associated confinement feeding operation structures
  2 15 (structures) by the department of natural resources (DNR).  The
  2 16 bill provides that the master matrix (matrix) used to evaluate
  2 17 an application to construct a structure must be comprised of
  2 18 three categories used to assess its impact on air quality,
  2 19 water quality, and the neighboring community.  It also provides
  2 20 that an application must achieve a minimum threshold score of
  2 21 70 percent of all points possible for each category in order to
  2 22 be recommended for approval by a county board of supervisors
  2 23 (board) to DNR.  The bill's provisions do not apply, if a board
  2 24 recommended approval or disapproval of an application, or DNR
  2 25 approved or disapproved an application, on the basis of an
  2 26 evaluation completed prior to the effective date of the bill
  2 27 using the matrix as it existed at that time.
  2 28    BACKGROUND == USE OF THE MATRIX.  The purpose of the matrix
  2 29 is to produce a statistically verifiable basis for determining
  2 30 whether to approve or disapprove an application (Code section
  2 31 459.305).  A person preparing to construct a structure that
  2 32 is an unformed manure storage structure or a structure that
  2 33 is part of an operation of a certain size (at least 1,000
  2 34 animal units) must obtain a permit by DNR (Code section
  2 35 459.303).  As part of the permit review process, a board
  3  1 that has filed a construction evaluation resolution with DNR
  3  2 (Code section 459.304) may make a recommendation based on the
  3  3 results of completing the matrix.   In those circumstances, DNR
  3  4 is also required to conduct an independent evaluation of the
  3  5 application using the matrix.

  2 11    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== GENERAL.  This bill amends the
  2 12 "Animal Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which
  2 13 generally regulates confinement feeding operations (operations)
  2 14 including associated confinement feeding operation structures
  2 15 (structures) by the department of natural resources (DNR).  The
  2 16 bill provides that the master matrix (matrix) used to evaluate
  2 17 an application to construct a structure must be comprised of
  2 18 three categories used to assess its impact on air quality,
  2 19 water quality, and the neighboring community.  It also provides
  2 20 that an application must achieve a minimum threshold score of
  2 21 70 percent of all points possible for each category in order to
  2 22 be recommended for approval by a county board of supervisors
  2 23 (board) to DNR.  The bill's provisions do not apply, if a board
  2 24 recommended approval or disapproval of an application, or DNR
  2 25 approved or disapproved an application, on the basis of an
  2 26 evaluation completed prior to the effective date of the bill
  2 27 using the matrix as it existed at that time.
  2 28    BACKGROUND == USE OF THE MATRIX.  The purpose of the matrix
  2 29 is to produce a statistically verifiable basis for determining
  2 30 whether to approve or disapprove an application (Code section
  2 31 459.305).  A person preparing to construct a structure that
  2 32 is an unformed manure storage structure or a structure that
  2 33 is part of an operation of a certain size (at least 1,000
  2 34 animal units) must obtain a permit by DNR (Code section
  2 35 459.303).  As part of the permit review process, a board
  3  1 that has filed a construction evaluation resolution with DNR
  3  2 (Code section 459.304) may make a recommendation based on the
  3  3 results of completing the matrix.   In those circumstances, DNR
  3  4 is also required to conduct an independent evaluation of the
  3  5 application using the matrix.
