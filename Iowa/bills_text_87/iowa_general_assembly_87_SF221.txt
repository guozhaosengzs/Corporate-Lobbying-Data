  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Iowa Business Corporation
  6  3 Act" codified in Code chapter 490, by allowing a for=profit
  6  4 corporation to either incorporate as or become a benefit
  6  5 corporation with the purpose of operating in a responsible and
  6  6 sustainable manner, that promotes one or more public benefits,
  6  7 and that operates in a manner that considers the best interests
  6  8 of persons materially affected by its conduct (new Code
  6  9 section 490.1801(1)). A public benefit may be of an artistic,
  6 10 charitable, cultural, economic, educational, cultural,
  6 11 literary, religious, social, ecological, or scientific nature
  6 12 (new Code section 490.1801(2)). Both the Code chapter and the
  6 13 bill's amendments creating new division XVIII are based on
  6 14 model legislation prepared by the American bar association.
  6 15    DECLARATION.  In order to be regarded as a benefit
  6 16 corporation, the corporation's articles of incorporation
  6 17 (articles) must include a public benefit provision that
  6 18 expressly describes the corporation's public benefit (new Code
  6 19 section 490.1801(3)). Moreover, the corporation's benefit
  6 20 status must be identified in its corporate name (new Code
  6 21 section 490.1802). Consequently, a professional corporation
  6 22 which is also a benefit corporation must also identify itself
  6 23 as a form of benefit corporation (amended Code section 496C.5).
  6 24 In addition, stock issued by the benefit corporation must state
  6 25 its benefit status (new Code section 490.1804), as must any
  6 26 shareholder meeting notice (Code section 490.1806(1)).
  6 27    CHOICE TO FORM AS OR BECOME A BENEFIT ENTITY.  A new
  6 28 corporation may choose to form as a benefit corporation at
  6 29 the time of incorporation by filing its articles with the
  6 30 secretary of state, and an existing corporation may choose to
  6 31 become a benefit corporation by amending its filed articles.
  6 32 An existing corporation may also choose to become a benefit
  6 33 corporation by combining through merger or share exchange
  6 34 with a benefit corporation or similar foreign public benefit
  6 35 entity (new Code section 490.1803(1)). In any case, at least
  7  1 90 percent of the existing corporation's outstanding voting
  7  2 and nonvoting shares of each class and series must approve
  7  3 the choice. Dissenting shareholders are entitled to exercise
  7  4 ordinary appraisal rights (amended Code section 490.1302(1)).
  7  5 However, the approval of at least two=thirds (66 2/3 percent)
  7  6 of a benefit corporation's outstanding shares entitled to vote
  7  7 on the question is required to amend or eliminate a public
  7  8 benefit provision from its articles, or to merge with or agree
  7  9 to a share exchange with a nonbenefit entity (new Code section
  7 10 490.1803(2)).
  7 11    MANAGEMENT.  When making a decision affecting the business
  7 12 affairs of a benefit corporation, its board of directors
  7 13 must balance three criteria: its public benefit provision,
  7 14 the best interests of persons materially affected by the
  7 15 benefit corporation's conduct, and the traditional factor
  7 16 of its stockholders' pecuniary interests (new Code section
  7 17 490.1805(1)). A director does not have a duty to account for
  7 18 a business decision (new Code section 490.1805(2)), and a
  7 19 director's failure to consider a factor does not constitute
  7 20 an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the
  7 21 shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's
  7 22 articles (new Code section 490.1805(3)). However, at least
  7 23 5 percent of the corporation's shareholders may institute a
  7 24 derivative suit to enforce compliance with the corporation's
  7 25 public benefit provision, in part by alleging that the
  7 26 directors failed to properly perform their duties (new Code
  7 27 section 490.1807).
  7 28    REPORT.  The benefit corporation must prepare and deliver a
  7 29 report to shareholders that addresses how its public benefit
  7 30 provision is being promoted and persons materially affected
  7 31 by the corporation's conduct (new Code section 490.1806(2)).
  7 32 The benefit corporation's directors are responsible for the
  7 33 report's preparation. The corporation's articles may require
  7 34 the involvement by a third party, who may be responsible for
  7 35 certifying how the corporation addressed the public benefit
  8  1 or the best interests of those materially affected by the
  8  2 corporation's conduct. The report is not required to be
  8  3 disclosed to the public, or delivered more frequently than once
  8  4 every two years, unless otherwise specified in the benefit
  8  5 corporation's articles (new Code section 490.1806(3)).
  8  6    APPLICATION.  The special designation of a corporation as a
  8  7 benefit corporation does not by itself create an implication
  8  8 that different rules apply to nonbenefit corporations.
  8  9 However, a  specific provision governing a benefit corporation
  8 10 also does not affect any other provision that applies to a
  8 11 nonbenefit corporation unless otherwise expressly stated (new
  8 12 Code section 490.1808).

  7 19 director's failure to consider a factor does not constitute
  7 20 an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the
  7 21 shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's
  7 22 articles (new Code section 490.1805(3)). However, at least
  7 23 5 percent of the corporation's shareholders may institute a
  7 24 derivative suit to enforce compliance with the corporation's
  7 25 public benefit provision, in part by alleging that the
  7 26 directors failed to properly perform their duties (new Code
  7 27 section 490.1807).
  7 28    REPORT.  The benefit corporation must prepare and deliver a

  7 30 provision is being promoted and persons materially affected

  7  6 of a benefit corporation's outstanding shares entitled to vote
  7  7 on the question is required to amend or eliminate a public
  7  8 benefit provision from its articles, or to merge with or agree
  7  9 to a share exchange with a nonbenefit entity (new Code section
  7 10 490.1803(2)).
  7 11    MANAGEMENT.  When making a decision affecting the business
  7 12 affairs of a benefit corporation, its board of directors
  7 13 must balance three criteria: its public benefit provision,
  7 14 the best interests of persons materially affected by the
  7 15 benefit corporation's conduct, and the traditional factor
  7 16 of its stockholders' pecuniary interests (new Code section
  7 17 490.1805(1)). A director does not have a duty to account for
  7 18 a business decision (new Code section 490.1805(2)), and a
  7 19 director's failure to consider a factor does not constitute
  7 20 an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the
  7 21 shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's
  7 22 articles (new Code section 490.1805(3)). However, at least
  7 23 5 percent of the corporation's shareholders may institute a
  7 24 derivative suit to enforce compliance with the corporation's
  7 25 public benefit provision, in part by alleging that the
  7 26 directors failed to properly perform their duties (new Code
  7 27 section 490.1807).
  7 28    REPORT.  The benefit corporation must prepare and deliver a
  7 29 report to shareholders that addresses how its public benefit
  7 30 provision is being promoted and persons materially affected
  7 31 by the corporation's conduct (new Code section 490.1806(2)).
  7 32 The benefit corporation's directors are responsible for the
  7 33 report's preparation. The corporation's articles may require
  7 34 the involvement by a third party, who may be responsible for
  7 35 certifying how the corporation addressed the public benefit
  8  1 or the best interests of those materially affected by the
  8  2 corporation's conduct. The report is not required to be
  8  3 disclosed to the public, or delivered more frequently than once
  8  4 every two years, unless otherwise specified in the benefit
  8  5 corporation's articles (new Code section 490.1806(3)).
  8  6    APPLICATION.  The special designation of a corporation as a
  8  7 benefit corporation does not by itself create an implication
  8  8 that different rules apply to nonbenefit corporations.
  8  9 However, a  specific provision governing a benefit corporation
  8 10 also does not affect any other provision that applies to a
  8 11 nonbenefit corporation unless otherwise expressly stated (new
  8 12 Code section 490.1808).

  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Iowa Business Corporation
  6  3 Act" codified in Code chapter 490, by allowing a for=profit
  6  4 corporation to either incorporate as or become a benefit
  6  5 corporation with the purpose of operating in a responsible and
  6  6 sustainable manner, that promotes one or more public benefits,
  6  7 and that operates in a manner that considers the best interests
  6  8 of persons materially affected by its conduct (new Code
  6  9 section 490.1801(1)). A public benefit may be of an artistic,
  6 10 charitable, cultural, economic, educational, cultural,
  6 11 literary, religious, social, ecological, or scientific nature
  6 12 (new Code section 490.1801(2)). Both the Code chapter and the
  6 13 bill's amendments creating new division XVIII are based on
  6 14 model legislation prepared by the American bar association.
  6 15    DECLARATION.  In order to be regarded as a benefit
  6 16 corporation, the corporation's articles of incorporation
  6 17 (articles) must include a public benefit provision that
  6 18 expressly describes the corporation's public benefit (new Code
  6 19 section 490.1801(3)). Moreover, the corporation's benefit
  6 20 status must be identified in its corporate name (new Code
  6 21 section 490.1802). Consequently, a professional corporation
  6 22 which is also a benefit corporation must also identify itself
  6 23 as a form of benefit corporation (amended Code section 496C.5).
  6 24 In addition, stock issued by the benefit corporation must state
  6 25 its benefit status (new Code section 490.1804), as must any
  6 26 shareholder meeting notice (Code section 490.1806(1)).
  6 27    CHOICE TO FORM AS OR BECOME A BENEFIT ENTITY.  A new
  6 28 corporation may choose to form as a benefit corporation at
  6 29 the time of incorporation by filing its articles with the
  6 30 secretary of state, and an existing corporation may choose to
  6 31 become a benefit corporation by amending its filed articles.
  6 32 An existing corporation may also choose to become a benefit
  6 33 corporation by combining through merger or share exchange
  6 34 with a benefit corporation or similar foreign public benefit
  6 35 entity (new Code section 490.1803(1)). In any case, at least
  7  1 90 percent of the existing corporation's outstanding voting
  7  2 and nonvoting shares of each class and series must approve
  7  3 the choice. Dissenting shareholders are entitled to exercise
  7  4 ordinary appraisal rights (amended Code section 490.1302(1)).
  7  5 However, the approval of at least two=thirds (66 2/3 percent)
  7  6 of a benefit corporation's outstanding shares entitled to vote
  7  7 on the question is required to amend or eliminate a public
  7  8 benefit provision from its articles, or to merge with or agree

  6  9 section 490.1801(1)). A public benefit may be of an artistic,
  6 10 charitable, cultural, economic, educational, cultural,
  6 11 literary, religious, social, ecological, or scientific nature
  6 12 (new Code section 490.1801(2)). Both the Code chapter and the
  6 13 bill's amendments creating new division XVIII are based on
  6 14 model legislation prepared by the American bar association.
  6 15    DECLARATION.  In order to be regarded as a benefit
  6 16 corporation, the corporation's articles of incorporation
  6 17 (articles) must include a public benefit provision that
  6 18 expressly describes the corporation's public benefit (new Code
  6 19 section 490.1801(3)). Moreover, the corporation's benefit
  6 20 status must be identified in its corporate name (new Code
  6 21 section 490.1802). Consequently, a professional corporation
  6 22 which is also a benefit corporation must also identify itself
  6 23 as a form of benefit corporation (amended Code section 496C.5).
  6 24 In addition, stock issued by the benefit corporation must state
  6 25 its benefit status (new Code section 490.1804), as must any
  6 26 shareholder meeting notice (Code section 490.1806(1)).
  6 27    CHOICE TO FORM AS OR BECOME A BENEFIT ENTITY.  A new
  6 28 corporation may choose to form as a benefit corporation at
  6 29 the time of incorporation by filing its articles with the
  6 30 secretary of state, and an existing corporation may choose to
  6 31 become a benefit corporation by amending its filed articles.
  6 32 An existing corporation may also choose to become a benefit
  6 33 corporation by combining through merger or share exchange
  6 34 with a benefit corporation or similar foreign public benefit
  6 35 entity (new Code section 490.1803(1)). In any case, at least
  7  1 90 percent of the existing corporation's outstanding voting
  7  2 and nonvoting shares of each class and series must approve
  7  3 the choice. Dissenting shareholders are entitled to exercise
  7  4 ordinary appraisal rights (amended Code section 490.1302(1)).
  7  5 However, the approval of at least two=thirds (66 2/3 percent)
  7  6 of a benefit corporation's outstanding shares entitled to vote
  7  7 on the question is required to amend or eliminate a public
  7  8 benefit provision from its articles, or to merge with or agree
  7  9 to a share exchange with a nonbenefit entity (new Code section
  7 10 490.1803(2)).
  7 11    MANAGEMENT.  When making a decision affecting the business
  7 12 affairs of a benefit corporation, its board of directors
  7 13 must balance three criteria: its public benefit provision,
  7 14 the best interests of persons materially affected by the
  7 15 benefit corporation's conduct, and the traditional factor
  7 16 of its stockholders' pecuniary interests (new Code section
  7 17 490.1805(1)). A director does not have a duty to account for
  7 18 a business decision (new Code section 490.1805(2)), and a
  7 19 director's failure to consider a factor does not constitute
  7 20 an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the
  7 21 shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's
  7 22 articles (new Code section 490.1805(3)). However, at least
  7 23 5 percent of the corporation's shareholders may institute a
  7 24 derivative suit to enforce compliance with the corporation's
  7 25 public benefit provision, in part by alleging that the
  7 26 directors failed to properly perform their duties (new Code
  7 27 section 490.1807).
  7 28    REPORT.  The benefit corporation must prepare and deliver a
  7 29 report to shareholders that addresses how its public benefit
  7 30 provision is being promoted and persons materially affected
  7 31 by the corporation's conduct (new Code section 490.1806(2)).
  7 32 The benefit corporation's directors are responsible for the
  7 33 report's preparation. The corporation's articles may require
  7 34 the involvement by a third party, who may be responsible for
  7 35 certifying how the corporation addressed the public benefit
  8  1 or the best interests of those materially affected by the
  8  2 corporation's conduct. The report is not required to be
  8  3 disclosed to the public, or delivered more frequently than once
  8  4 every two years, unless otherwise specified in the benefit
  8  5 corporation's articles (new Code section 490.1806(3)).
  8  6    APPLICATION.  The special designation of a corporation as a
  8  7 benefit corporation does not by itself create an implication
  8  8 that different rules apply to nonbenefit corporations.
  8  9 However, a  specific provision governing a benefit corporation
  8 10 also does not affect any other provision that applies to a
  8 11 nonbenefit corporation unless otherwise expressly stated (new
  8 12 Code section 490.1808).

  8  8 that different rules apply to nonbenefit corporations.

  6  7 and that operates in a manner that considers the best interests
  6  8 of persons materially affected by its conduct (new Code
  6  9 section 490.1801(1)). A public benefit may be of an artistic,
  6 10 charitable, cultural, economic, educational, cultural,
  6 11 literary, religious, social, ecological, or scientific nature
  6 12 (new Code section 490.1801(2)). Both the Code chapter and the
  6 13 bill's amendments creating new division XVIII are based on
  6 14 model legislation prepared by the American bar association.
  6 15    DECLARATION.  In order to be regarded as a benefit
  6 16 corporation, the corporation's articles of incorporation
  6 17 (articles) must include a public benefit provision that
  6 18 expressly describes the corporation's public benefit (new Code
  6 19 section 490.1801(3)). Moreover, the corporation's benefit
  6 20 status must be identified in its corporate name (new Code
  6 21 section 490.1802). Consequently, a professional corporation
  6 22 which is also a benefit corporation must also identify itself
  6 23 as a form of benefit corporation (amended Code section 496C.5).
  6 24 In addition, stock issued by the benefit corporation must state
  6 25 its benefit status (new Code section 490.1804), as must any
  6 26 shareholder meeting notice (Code section 490.1806(1)).
  6 27    CHOICE TO FORM AS OR BECOME A BENEFIT ENTITY.  A new
  6 28 corporation may choose to form as a benefit corporation at
  6 29 the time of incorporation by filing its articles with the
  6 30 secretary of state, and an existing corporation may choose to
  6 31 become a benefit corporation by amending its filed articles.
  6 32 An existing corporation may also choose to become a benefit
  6 33 corporation by combining through merger or share exchange
  6 34 with a benefit corporation or similar foreign public benefit
  6 35 entity (new Code section 490.1803(1)). In any case, at least
  7  1 90 percent of the existing corporation's outstanding voting
  7  2 and nonvoting shares of each class and series must approve
  7  3 the choice. Dissenting shareholders are entitled to exercise
  7  4 ordinary appraisal rights (amended Code section 490.1302(1)).
  7  5 However, the approval of at least two=thirds (66 2/3 percent)
  7  6 of a benefit corporation's outstanding shares entitled to vote
  7  7 on the question is required to amend or eliminate a public
  7  8 benefit provision from its articles, or to merge with or agree
  7  9 to a share exchange with a nonbenefit entity (new Code section
  7 10 490.1803(2)).
  7 11    MANAGEMENT.  When making a decision affecting the business
  7 12 affairs of a benefit corporation, its board of directors
  7 13 must balance three criteria: its public benefit provision,
  7 14 the best interests of persons materially affected by the
  7 15 benefit corporation's conduct, and the traditional factor
  7 16 of its stockholders' pecuniary interests (new Code section
  7 17 490.1805(1)). A director does not have a duty to account for
  7 18 a business decision (new Code section 490.1805(2)), and a
  7 19 director's failure to consider a factor does not constitute
  7 20 an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the
  7 21 shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's
  7 22 articles (new Code section 490.1805(3)). However, at least
  7 23 5 percent of the corporation's shareholders may institute a
  7 24 derivative suit to enforce compliance with the corporation's
  7 25 public benefit provision, in part by alleging that the
  7 26 directors failed to properly perform their duties (new Code
  7 27 section 490.1807).
  7 28    REPORT.  The benefit corporation must prepare and deliver a
  7 29 report to shareholders that addresses how its public benefit
  7 30 provision is being promoted and persons materially affected
  7 31 by the corporation's conduct (new Code section 490.1806(2)).
  7 32 The benefit corporation's directors are responsible for the
  7 33 report's preparation. The corporation's articles may require
  7 34 the involvement by a third party, who may be responsible for
  7 35 certifying how the corporation addressed the public benefit
  8  1 or the best interests of those materially affected by the
  8  2 corporation's conduct. The report is not required to be
  8  3 disclosed to the public, or delivered more frequently than once
  8  4 every two years, unless otherwise specified in the benefit
  8  5 corporation's articles (new Code section 490.1806(3)).
  8  6    APPLICATION.  The special designation of a corporation as a
  8  7 benefit corporation does not by itself create an implication
  8  8 that different rules apply to nonbenefit corporations.
  8  9 However, a  specific provision governing a benefit corporation
  8 10 also does not affect any other provision that applies to a

  6 20 status must be identified in its corporate name (new Code
  6 21 section 490.1802). Consequently, a professional corporation
  6 22 which is also a benefit corporation must also identify itself
  6 23 as a form of benefit corporation (amended Code section 496C.5).
  6 24 In addition, stock issued by the benefit corporation must state
  6 25 its benefit status (new Code section 490.1804), as must any
  6 26 shareholder meeting notice (Code section 490.1806(1)).
  6 27    CHOICE TO FORM AS OR BECOME A BENEFIT ENTITY.  A new
  6 28 corporation may choose to form as a benefit corporation at
  6 29 the time of incorporation by filing its articles with the
  6 30 secretary of state, and an existing corporation may choose to
  6 31 become a benefit corporation by amending its filed articles.
  6 32 An existing corporation may also choose to become a benefit
  6 33 corporation by combining through merger or share exchange
  6 34 with a benefit corporation or similar foreign public benefit
  6 35 entity (new Code section 490.1803(1)). In any case, at least
  7  1 90 percent of the existing corporation's outstanding voting
  7  2 and nonvoting shares of each class and series must approve
  7  3 the choice. Dissenting shareholders are entitled to exercise
  7  4 ordinary appraisal rights (amended Code section 490.1302(1)).
  7  5 However, the approval of at least two=thirds (66 2/3 percent)
  7  6 of a benefit corporation's outstanding shares entitled to vote
  7  7 on the question is required to amend or eliminate a public
  7  8 benefit provision from its articles, or to merge with or agree
  7  9 to a share exchange with a nonbenefit entity (new Code section
  7 10 490.1803(2)).
  7 11    MANAGEMENT.  When making a decision affecting the business
  7 12 affairs of a benefit corporation, its board of directors
  7 13 must balance three criteria: its public benefit provision,
  7 14 the best interests of persons materially affected by the
  7 15 benefit corporation's conduct, and the traditional factor
  7 16 of its stockholders' pecuniary interests (new Code section
  7 17 490.1805(1)). A director does not have a duty to account for
  7 18 a business decision (new Code section 490.1805(2)), and a
  7 19 director's failure to consider a factor does not constitute
  7 20 an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the
  7 21 shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's
  7 22 articles (new Code section 490.1805(3)). However, at least
  7 23 5 percent of the corporation's shareholders may institute a
  7 24 derivative suit to enforce compliance with the corporation's
  7 25 public benefit provision, in part by alleging that the
  7 26 directors failed to properly perform their duties (new Code
  7 27 section 490.1807).
  7 28    REPORT.  The benefit corporation must prepare and deliver a
  7 29 report to shareholders that addresses how its public benefit
  7 30 provision is being promoted and persons materially affected
  7 31 by the corporation's conduct (new Code section 490.1806(2)).
  7 32 The benefit corporation's directors are responsible for the
  7 33 report's preparation. The corporation's articles may require
  7 34 the involvement by a third party, who may be responsible for
  7 35 certifying how the corporation addressed the public benefit
  8  1 or the best interests of those materially affected by the
  8  2 corporation's conduct. The report is not required to be
  8  3 disclosed to the public, or delivered more frequently than once
  8  4 every two years, unless otherwise specified in the benefit
  8  5 corporation's articles (new Code section 490.1806(3)).
  8  6    APPLICATION.  The special designation of a corporation as a
  8  7 benefit corporation does not by itself create an implication
  8  8 that different rules apply to nonbenefit corporations.
  8  9 However, a  specific provision governing a benefit corporation
  8 10 also does not affect any other provision that applies to a
  8 11 nonbenefit corporation unless otherwise expressly stated (new

  7 28    REPORT.  The benefit corporation must prepare and deliver a
  7 29 report to shareholders that addresses how its public benefit
  7 30 provision is being promoted and persons materially affected
  7 31 by the corporation's conduct (new Code section 490.1806(2)).
  7 32 The benefit corporation's directors are responsible for the
  7 33 report's preparation. The corporation's articles may require
  7 34 the involvement by a third party, who may be responsible for
  7 35 certifying how the corporation addressed the public benefit
  8  1 or the best interests of those materially affected by the
  8  2 corporation's conduct. The report is not required to be
  8  3 disclosed to the public, or delivered more frequently than once
  8  4 every two years, unless otherwise specified in the benefit
  8  5 corporation's articles (new Code section 490.1806(3)).

  6 17 (articles) must include a public benefit provision that
  6 18 expressly describes the corporation's public benefit (new Code
  6 19 section 490.1801(3)). Moreover, the corporation's benefit
  6 20 status must be identified in its corporate name (new Code
  6 21 section 490.1802). Consequently, a professional corporation
  6 22 which is also a benefit corporation must also identify itself
  6 23 as a form of benefit corporation (amended Code section 496C.5).
  6 24 In addition, stock issued by the benefit corporation must state
  6 25 its benefit status (new Code section 490.1804), as must any
  6 26 shareholder meeting notice (Code section 490.1806(1)).
  6 27    CHOICE TO FORM AS OR BECOME A BENEFIT ENTITY.  A new
  6 28 corporation may choose to form as a benefit corporation at
  6 29 the time of incorporation by filing its articles with the
  6 30 secretary of state, and an existing corporation may choose to
  6 31 become a benefit corporation by amending its filed articles.
  6 32 An existing corporation may also choose to become a benefit
  6 33 corporation by combining through merger or share exchange
  6 34 with a benefit corporation or similar foreign public benefit
  6 35 entity (new Code section 490.1803(1)). In any case, at least
  7  1 90 percent of the existing corporation's outstanding voting
  7  2 and nonvoting shares of each class and series must approve
  7  3 the choice. Dissenting shareholders are entitled to exercise
  7  4 ordinary appraisal rights (amended Code section 490.1302(1)).
  7  5 However, the approval of at least two=thirds (66 2/3 percent)
  7  6 of a benefit corporation's outstanding shares entitled to vote
  7  7 on the question is required to amend or eliminate a public
  7  8 benefit provision from its articles, or to merge with or agree
  7  9 to a share exchange with a nonbenefit entity (new Code section
  7 10 490.1803(2)).
  7 11    MANAGEMENT.  When making a decision affecting the business
  7 12 affairs of a benefit corporation, its board of directors
  7 13 must balance three criteria: its public benefit provision,
  7 14 the best interests of persons materially affected by the
  7 15 benefit corporation's conduct, and the traditional factor
  7 16 of its stockholders' pecuniary interests (new Code section
  7 17 490.1805(1)). A director does not have a duty to account for
  7 18 a business decision (new Code section 490.1805(2)), and a
  7 19 director's failure to consider a factor does not constitute
  7 20 an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the
  7 21 shareholders, unless otherwise provided in the corporation's
  7 22 articles (new Code section 490.1805(3)). However, at least
  7 23 5 percent of the corporation's shareholders may institute a
  7 24 derivative suit to enforce compliance with the corporation's
  7 25 public benefit provision, in part by alleging that the
  7 26 directors failed to properly perform their duties (new Code
  7 27 section 490.1807).
  7 28    REPORT.  The benefit corporation must prepare and deliver a

  6 34 with a benefit corporation or similar foreign public benefit
  6 35 entity (new Code section 490.1803(1)). In any case, at least
