If
returning

shall

6


the

A

paramount

in

reasonable

Reasonable
9


efforts
may

services,
if
the
child’s
safety
in

time
the

In
determining
12


whether
reasonable

have
been
made,
the

consider
both
of
the
following:
14


(1)

type,
duration,

intensity
of
services
or
support
15


offered
or
provided
to
the
child
and
the
child’s
family.
If
16


family-centered
services
were
not

the
court
record
17


shall
enumerate
the
reasons
the
services
were
not
provided,
18


including
but
not
limited
to
whether
the
services
were
not
19


available,
not
accepted
by
the
child’s
family,
judged
to
be
20


unable
to
protect
the
child
and
the
child’s
family
during
21


the
time
the
services
would
have
been
provided,
judged
to
be
22


unlikely
to
be
successful
in
resolving
the
problems
which
would
23


lead
to
removal
of
the
child,
or
other
services
were
found
to
24


be
more
appropriate.
25


(2)
The
relative
risk
to
the
child
of
remaining
in
the

versus
removal
of
the

As
