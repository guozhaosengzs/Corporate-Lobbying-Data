This
bill
establishes
a
motor
vehicle
insurance
verification
14


program
to
be
administered
by
the
department
of
transportation
15


(DOT).
Following
the

required
to
contract

a
third
17


party
for
four

20


to

on
the
best
methods

At
least
twice
per
month,
the
designated
agent
must
update
the
1


database
and
compare
current
motor
vehicle
registrations
with
2


updated
insurance
information.
If
records
in
the
database
3


indicate
that
a
registered
motor
vehicle
is
not
covered
under
4


an
owner’s
policy
of
liability
insurance,
the
bill
requires
the
5


designated
agent
to
use
a
real-time
internet
services
model
6


to
determine
if
the
registered
motor
vehicle
is
covered
under
7


an
owner’s
policy
of
liability
insurance.
The
files
in
the
8


database
must
be
archived
semiannually
and
audited
by
the
DOT
9


at
least
annually.
10


If
database
records
and
the
real-time
internet
services
11


model
show
that
a
registered
motor
vehicle
is
not
covered
under
12


an
owner’s
policy
of
liability
insurance
for
three
consecutive
13


months,
the
designated
agent
is
required
to
send
a
notice
to
14


the
owner
requiring
the
owner
to
respond
within
15
days
by
15


providing
proof
of
financial
liability
coverage
or
proof
that
16


the
owner
is
exempt
from
the
requirement
to
maintain
financial
17


liability
coverage.
If
the
owner
fails
to
respond,
a
second
18


notice
must
be
sent.
If
the
owner
does
not
respond
to
the
19


second
notice,
the
owner’s
motor
vehicle
registration
must
20


be
revoked
by
the
DOT
and
the
owner
is
required
to
surrender
21


the
registration
plates
and
registration
receipt
for
the
22


vehicle
to
the
county
treasurer.
In
order
to
obtain
a
new
23


registration
for
the
vehicle,
the
owner
must
comply
with
24


financial
responsibility
requirements
and
pay
an
administrative
25


fee
of
$100.
The
fees
collected
are
to
be
used
by
the
DOT
26


exclusively
to
offset
the
costs
of
administering
the
program,
27


including
payments
made
to
the
designated
agent.
28


The
bill
provides
that
if
a
motor
vehicle
is
covered
by
a
29


form
of
financial
liability
coverage
other
than
an
insurance
30


policy,
or
if
a
real-time
internet
services
model
indicates
a
31


vehicle
is
appropriately
insured,
that
fact
shall
be
noted
in
32


the
database.
33


The
bill
prohibits

from
providing
false
or
