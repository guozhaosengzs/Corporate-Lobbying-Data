  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science

  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.

  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings
  6  3 for the delivery of high=quality high school computer science
  6  4 courses, including traditional high school classes, concurrent
  6  5 enrollment classes, and online learning classes that include
  6  6 the opportunity for students to collaborate within a classroom
  6  7 setting; guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  6  8 12 career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  6  9 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,

  4  5                           EXPLANATION
  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings
  6  3 for the delivery of high=quality high school computer science
  6  4 courses, including traditional high school classes, concurrent
  6  5 enrollment classes, and online learning classes that include
  6  6 the opportunity for students to collaborate within a classroom
  6  7 setting; guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  6  8 12 career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  6  9 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,
  6 17 nonvoting legislative members.  The work group must submit
  6 18 its findings and recommendations, including any proposed
  6 19 legislation, in a report to the governor, the state board of
  6 20 education, and the general assembly by November 1, 2017.

  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings

  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,
  6 17 nonvoting legislative members.  The work group must submit
  6 18 its findings and recommendations, including any proposed

  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.

  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.

  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.

  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science

  4  5                           EXPLANATION
  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings
  6  3 for the delivery of high=quality high school computer science
  6  4 courses, including traditional high school classes, concurrent
  6  5 enrollment classes, and online learning classes that include
  6  6 the opportunity for students to collaborate within a classroom
  6  7 setting; guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  6  8 12 career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  6  9 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,
  6 17 nonvoting legislative members.  The work group must submit
  6 18 its findings and recommendations, including any proposed
  6 19 legislation, in a report to the governor, the state board of
  6 20 education, and the general assembly by November 1, 2017.

  4  5                           EXPLANATION
  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings
  6  3 for the delivery of high=quality high school computer science
  6  4 courses, including traditional high school classes, concurrent
  6  5 enrollment classes, and online learning classes that include
  6  6 the opportunity for students to collaborate within a classroom
  6  7 setting; guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  6  8 12 career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  6  9 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,
  6 17 nonvoting legislative members.  The work group must submit
  6 18 its findings and recommendations, including any proposed
  6 19 legislation, in a report to the governor, the state board of
  6 20 education, and the general assembly by November 1, 2017.

  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the

  4  5                           EXPLANATION
  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings
  6  3 for the delivery of high=quality high school computer science
  6  4 courses, including traditional high school classes, concurrent
  6  5 enrollment classes, and online learning classes that include
  6  6 the opportunity for students to collaborate within a classroom
  6  7 setting; guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  6  8 12 career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  6  9 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,

  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings
  6  3 for the delivery of high=quality high school computer science
  6  4 courses, including traditional high school classes, concurrent
  6  5 enrollment classes, and online learning classes that include
  6  6 the opportunity for students to collaborate within a classroom
  6  7 setting; guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  6  8 12 career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  6  9 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,
  6 17 nonvoting legislative members.  The work group must submit
  6 18 its findings and recommendations, including any proposed
  6 19 legislation, in a report to the governor, the state board of
  6 20 education, and the general assembly by November 1, 2017.

  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings
  6  3 for the delivery of high=quality high school computer science
  6  4 courses, including traditional high school classes, concurrent

  6  7 setting; guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  6  8 12 career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  6  9 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,

  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings

  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill requires the state board of education to adopt
  4  9 computer science education standards, requires the board of
  4 10 educational examiners to establish computer science instructor
  4 11 endorsements and authorizations and alternative pathways to
  4 12 obtain such endorsements and authorizations, establishes a
  4 13 computer science professional development incentive fund in
  4 14 the state treasury, and directs the department of education to
  4 15 convene a computer science education work group.
  4 16    The bill directs the state board of education to adopt rules
  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
  4 24 provided in Code section 17A.4(1)(a) by December 13, 2017.
  4 25    The board of educational examiners is directed to establish
  4 26 by rule endorsements and authorizations for computer science
  4 27 instruction, including traditional and nontraditional pathways
  4 28 for obtaining such endorsements or authorizations.
  4 29    Under the bill, the general assembly finds and declares
  4 30 that instruction in high=quality computer science for
  4 31 elementary, middle school, and high school students establishes
  4 32 a foundation for personal and professional success in a
  4 33 high=technology, knowledge=based Iowa economy.  The goal of
  4 34 the general assembly is for each accredited high school to
  4 35 offer at least one high=quality computer science course, each
  5  1 accredited middle school to offer instruction in exploratory
  5  2 computer science, and each accredited elementary school to
  5  3 offer instruction in the basics of computer science.
  5  4    It is the intent of the general assembly to appropriate
  5  5 moneys for purposes of the computer science professional
  5  6 development incentive fund for the fiscal year beginning July
  5  7 1, 2018.  The fund is established by the bill in the state
  5  8 treasury under the control of the department, subject to an
  5  9 appropriation of sufficient funds by the general assembly.
  5 10    Moneys from the fund can be disbursed to a school district
  5 11 or accredited nonpublic school, or a collaborative of one or
  5 12 more school districts, accredited nonpublic schools, and area
  5 13 education agencies, to provide proven professional development
  5 14 activities for Iowa teachers in the area of computer science
  5 15 education. A school district, accredited nonpublic school, or
  5 16 a collaborative, as appropriate, must apply to the department
  5 17 in the manner prescribed by the department in order to
  5 18 receive moneys from the fund. Moneys in the fund that remain
  5 19 unencumbered or unobligated at the close of the fiscal year
  5 20 shall not revert but shall remain available for expenditure
  5 21 for the purposes designated until the close of the succeeding
  5 22 fiscal year.
  5 23    The bill requires the director of the department of
  5 24 education to convene a computer science education work group
  5 25 to identify and recommend measures for incentivizing school
  5 26 districts and accredited nonpublic schools to meet, by the
  5 27 school year beginning July 1, 2019, the goals of offering at
  5 28 least one high=quality computer science course in each high
  5 29 school, offering instruction in exploratory computer science in
  5 30 each middle school, and offering instruction in the basics of
  5 31 computer science in each elementary school.
  5 32    The work group must also develop recommendations that, at
  5 33 a minimum, address or identify how one or more high=quality
  5 34 computer science courses can satisfy high school graduation
  5 35 requirements for mathematics or science; how one or more
  6  1 high=quality computer science courses can be integrated into
  6  2 a career and technical education pathway; multiple settings
  6  3 for the delivery of high=quality high school computer science
  6  4 courses, including traditional high school classes, concurrent
  6  5 enrollment classes, and online learning classes that include
  6  6 the opportunity for students to collaborate within a classroom
  6  7 setting; guidelines for creating a kindergarten through grade
  6  8 12 career pathway in computer science, with an appropriate
  6  9 scope and sequence for high=quality computer science
  6 10 instruction at each such grade level; and how the computer
  6 11 science professional development incentive fund could be used
  6 12 to meet the computer science instruction goals.
  6 13    The work group's membership must represent kindergarten
  6 14 through grade 12 school districts and accredited nonpublic
  6 15 schools, higher education, business, labor, and other
  6 16 appropriate stakeholders, and include four ex officio,
  6 17 nonvoting legislative members.  The work group must submit
  6 18 its findings and recommendations, including any proposed
  6 19 legislation, in a report to the governor, the state board of
  6 20 education, and the general assembly by November 1, 2017.

  4 17 providing for the establishment of high=quality standards
  4 18 for computer science education taught by elementary, middle,
  4 19 and high schools. The rules shall be applicable only to
  4 20 those school districts and schools that receive moneys from
  4 21 the incentive fund or from other funds administered by the
  4 22 department for the same purposes as specified for the incentive
  4 23 fund. The state board must submit notice of intended action as
