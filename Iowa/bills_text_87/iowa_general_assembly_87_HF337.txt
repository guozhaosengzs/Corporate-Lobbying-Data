  1 15    1.  In response to the transportation costs per pupil
  1 16 inequity among school districts in this state, this section
  1 17 and section 257.17B establish a transportation equity program
  1 18 to provide prioritized funding for school districts based on
  1 19 each school district's average transportation costs per pupil
  1 20 by modifying the allocation of the total amount of foundation
  1 21 program aid growth among school districts using a methodology
  1 22 based upon the proportional amount that each school district's
  1 23 transportation costs per pupil exceed or are less than the
  1 24 average transportation costs per pupil.
  1 25    2.  a.  For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, and
  1 26 each succeeding budget year for which the state percent
  1 27 of growth is greater than zero, each school district shall
  1 28 receive transportation equity aid in an amount calculated by
  1 29 the department of management equal to the school district's
  1 30 budget enrollment multiplied by the school district's adjusted

  2  7 base year, minus the statewide foundation property tax for the
  2  8 base year.
  2  9    (3)  "Budget year state aid" equals the product of
  2 10 eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of the state cost per
  2 11 pupil for the budget year multiplied by the statewide budget
  2 12 enrollment for the budget year, minus the statewide foundation
  2 13 property tax for the budget year.

  4 24 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  4 25 districts.
  4 26    The bill establishes a transportation equity program
  4 27 to provide prioritized funding for school districts based
  4 28 on each school district's average transportation costs per
  4 29 pupil. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, and
  4 30 each succeeding budget year for which the state percent of
  4 31 growth is greater than zero, each qualified school district
  4 32 receives transportation equity aid in an amount equal to the
  4 33 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by the school
  4 34 district's adjusted transportation equity amount as calculated
  4 35 in the bill.
  5  1 The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  5  2 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  5  3 beginning July 1, 2018, and each budget year thereafter, the
  5  4 appropriation is equal to the sum of the budget enrollments for
  5  5 all school districts in the state multiplied by the state aid
  5  6 growth factor per pupil for the budget year.
  5  7    Transportation equity aid payments received under the bill
  5  8 are miscellaneous income and must be deposited in the general
  5  9 fund of the school district. Transportation equity aid does
  5 10 not affect the receipt or amount of transportation assistance
  5 11 aid received by a school district from the school budget review
  5 12 committee under Code section 257.31(17).
  5 13    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  5 14 1, 2018, for which the state percent of growth is greater than
  5 15 zero, the department of management is required to reduce the
  5 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  5 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  5 18 formula.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the school
  5 19 district's budget enrollment multiplied by the state aid growth
  5 20 factor per pupil as calculated in the bill.
  5 21    The department of management is required to notify each
  5 22 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  5 23 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  5 24 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
  5 25 recalculation of any property tax levy rate for the budget year

  4 29 pupil. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, and
  4 30 each succeeding budget year for which the state percent of
  4 31 growth is greater than zero, each qualified school district
  4 32 receives transportation equity aid in an amount equal to the
  4 33 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by the school
  4 34 district's adjusted transportation equity amount as calculated

  4 22    This bill relates to public school funding by establishing
  4 23 a transportation equity program and requiring reductions to
  4 24 regular program state foundation aid amounts payable to school
  4 25 districts.
  4 26    The bill establishes a transportation equity program
  4 27 to provide prioritized funding for school districts based
  4 28 on each school district's average transportation costs per
  4 29 pupil. For the budget year beginning July 1, 2018, and
  4 30 each succeeding budget year for which the state percent of
  4 31 growth is greater than zero, each qualified school district
  4 32 receives transportation equity aid in an amount equal to the
  4 33 school district's budget enrollment multiplied by the school
  4 34 district's adjusted transportation equity amount as calculated
  4 35 in the bill.
  5  1 The bill creates a transportation equity fund under the
  5  2 control of the department of management. For the budget year
  5  3 beginning July 1, 2018, and each budget year thereafter, the
  5  4 appropriation is equal to the sum of the budget enrollments for
  5  5 all school districts in the state multiplied by the state aid
  5  6 growth factor per pupil for the budget year.
  5  7    Transportation equity aid payments received under the bill
  5  8 are miscellaneous income and must be deposited in the general
  5  9 fund of the school district. Transportation equity aid does
  5 10 not affect the receipt or amount of transportation assistance
  5 11 aid received by a school district from the school budget review
  5 12 committee under Code section 257.31(17).
  5 13    Under the bill, for budget years beginning on or after July
  5 14 1, 2018, for which the state percent of growth is greater than
  5 15 zero, the department of management is required to reduce the
  5 16 total amount of regular program state foundation aid payable
  5 17 to each school district under the school foundation funding
  5 18 formula.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the school
  5 19 district's budget enrollment multiplied by the state aid growth
  5 20 factor per pupil as calculated in the bill.
  5 21    The department of management is required to notify each
  5 22 school district annually of the amount of the reduction to
  5 23 regular program state foundation aid. The bill does not
  5 24 permit the recalculation of other state aid amounts or the
