  2 19    This bill modifies the periods of time to bring civil actions
  2 20 relating to young persons and persons with mental illness.
  2 21    Under current Code section 614.1(12), a civil action for
  2 22 damages for injury suffered as result of sexual abuse, as
  2 23 defined in Code section 709.1, or sexual exploitation, by a
  2 24 counselor, therapist, or school employee, each as defined in
  2 25 Code section 709.15, can only be brought within five years
  2 26 after the date that the victim was either last treated by the
  2 27 counselor or therapist or last enrolled in or attended the
  2 28 school. The bill amends the current law to provide that a
  2 29 victim may bring such an action within 10 years of the date
  2 30 that the victim was either last treated by the counselor or
  2 31 therapist or last enrolled in or attended the school.
  2 32    Under current Code section 614.8, the applicable limitations
  2 33 period in which to bring certain civil actions is extended for
  2 34 persons with mental illness and minors. Under current Code
  2 35 section 670.2, a municipality is subject to liability for the
  3  1 municipality's torts and those of the municipality's officers
  3  2 and employees, acting within the scope of such officers'
  3  3 and employees' employment or duties. Under current Code
  3  4 section 670.5, an action for damages for an injury against a
  3  5 municipality cannot be brought after two years of the alleged
  3  6 injury, except as provided in Code section 614.8.
  3  7    The bill amends Code section 614.8 to specify that the
  3  8 extension of the limitations period for persons with mental
  3  9 illness and for minors applies to claims brought pursuant to
  3 10 Code chapter 670, which chapter is already referenced at the
  3 11 beginning of the sentences extending the limitations period.
  3 12    The amendment to Code section 614.8A in the bill extends
  3 13 the time for filing a civil action relating to sexual abuse
  3 14 which occurred when the injured person was a minor from one
  3 15 year after the attainment of majority to 25 years after the
  3 16 attainment of majority.
  3 17    The amendment to Code section 614.8A in the bill also
  3 18 provides that a civil action for damages relating to sexual
  3 19 abuse which occurred when the injured party was a child shall
  3 20 be brought within 25 years from the time of the discovery of
  3 21 both the injury and the causal relationship between the injury
  3 22 and the sexual abuse.  Current law specifies such an action
  3 23 shall be brought within four years from the time of discovery
  3 24 of both the injury and the causal relationship between the
  3 25 injury and the sexual abuse.

  2 29 victim may bring such an action within 10 years of the date
  2 30 that the victim was either last treated by the counselor or
  2 31 therapist or last enrolled in or attended the school.
  2 32    Under current Code section 614.8, the applicable limitations
