  1 18    Sec. 2.    1 18    Sec. 2.    1 19 enforcement systems.
  1 20    1.  The department shall not place, operate, maintain,
  1 21 or employ the use of any automated traffic law enforcement
  1 22 system. The department shall not cause to be placed any
  1 23 automated traffic law enforcement system except as provided in
  1 24 this section or in rules adopted by the department under this
  1 25 section.
  1 26    2.  a.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  1 27 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  1 28 enforcement system without the approval of the department. The
  1 29 department shall approve the operation of an automated traffic
  1 30 law enforcement system only if the department determines the
  1 31 system is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk
  1 32 location at which there is a demonstrated safety need for
  1 33 the system. The department shall make such a determination
  1 34 about a location based on the volume of traffic, the history
  1 35 of motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  2  1 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  2  2 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  2  3 deemed appropriate by the department and set forth in rules
  2  4 adopted by the department. The department shall separately
  2  5 approve each location at which a local authority, or another
  2  6 entity on a local authority's behalf, operates a mobile
  2  7 automated traffic law enforcement system. This paragraph "a"
  2  8 shall not apply to an automated traffic law enforcement system
  2  9 approved by the department and in operation prior to January
  2 10 1, 2017. A local authority may continue to operate such a
  2 11 system in the same manner as the system was operated prior to
  2 12 January 1, 2017. However, after a local authority discontinues
  2 13 operation of the system, any new manner of operation or new
  2 14 system operated by the local authority shall comply with this
  2 15 paragraph "a".
  2 16    b.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  2 17 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  2 18 enforcement system without posting signage meeting all of the
  2 19 following requirements:
  2 20    (1)  For a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system,
  2 21 permanent signs advising drivers that the system is in place
  2 22 shall be posted in clear and present view of passing drivers in
  2 23 advance of the location where the system is in use.
  2 24    (2)  For a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system,
  2 25 temporary or permanent signs advising drivers that the system
  2 26 is in place shall be posted in clear and present view of
  2 27 passing drivers in advance of the location where the system is
  2 28 in use as agreed to by the department and the local authority.
  2 29    (3)  The signage conforms to the manual on uniform
  2 30 traffic=control devices as adopted by the department.
  2 31    c.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  2 32 authority's behalf, shall not issue a citation resulting from
  2 33 the use of an automated traffic law enforcement system until a
  2 34 peace officer of the local authority has reviewed the citation
  2 35 and any relevant recorded images produced by the system.
  3  1    d.  The amount of the fine or civil penalty imposed by a
  3  2 citation resulting from the use of an automated traffic law
  3  3 enforcement system shall not exceed the amount of the fine for
  3  4 a scheduled violation under section 805.8A for the same or a
  3  5 similar violation of this chapter.
  3  6    e.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  3  7 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  3  8 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  3  9 procedures for operating the system. A local authority,
  3 10 or another entity on a local authority's behalf, operating
  3 11 such a system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether
  3 12 the local authority or entity successfully performed the
  3 13 manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The local
  3 14 authority or entity shall also perform a weekly calibration
  3 15 check of the system, and documentation of the calibration check
  3 16 shall be retained by the local authority or entity. The log
  3 17 and documentation of the calibration checks shall be admissible
  3 18 in any court proceeding related to a violation of section
  3 19 321.257 or 321.285.
  3 20    f.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
  3 21 subsection, including but not limited to rules relating to the
  3 22 size and location of signage advising drivers that an automated
  3 23 traffic law enforcement system is in place.
  3 24    3.  All moneys collected by a local authority from
  3 25 citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  3 26 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary
  3 27 for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the
  3 28 automated traffic law enforcement system, shall be deposited
  3 29 in the account or accounts maintained by the local authority
  3 30 for moneys appropriated to the local authority from the
  3 31 secondary road fund or street construction fund of the cities,
  3 32 as applicable. This subsection shall not apply to moneys
  3 33 collected for court costs or other associated costs, the
  3 34 criminal penalty surcharge required by section 911.1, or the
  3 35 county enforcement surcharge required by section 911.4.
  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  1 32 location at which there is a demonstrated safety need for
  1 33 the system. The department shall make such a determination
  1 34 about a location based on the volume of traffic, the history
  1 35 of motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  2  1 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional

  2  7 automated traffic law enforcement system. This paragraph "a"
  2  8 shall not apply to an automated traffic law enforcement system
  2  9 approved by the department and in operation prior to January
  2 10 1, 2017. A local authority may continue to operate such a
  2 11 system in the same manner as the system was operated prior to
  2 12 January 1, 2017. However, after a local authority discontinues
  2 13 operation of the system, any new manner of operation or new
  2 14 system operated by the local authority shall comply with this
  2 15 paragraph "a".
  2 16    b.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  2 17 authority's behalf, shall not operate an automated traffic law
  2 18 enforcement system without posting signage meeting all of the
  2 19 following requirements:
  2 20    (1)  For a fixed automated traffic law enforcement system,

  2 24    (2)  For a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system,
  2 25 temporary or permanent signs advising drivers that the system
  2 26 is in place shall be posted in clear and present view of
  2 27 passing drivers in advance of the location where the system is
  2 28 in use as agreed to by the department and the local authority.
  2 29    (3)  The signage conforms to the manual on uniform
  2 30 traffic=control devices as adopted by the department.
  2 31    c.  A local authority, or another entity on a local
  2 32 authority's behalf, shall not issue a citation resulting from
  2 33 the use of an automated traffic law enforcement system until a
  2 34 peace officer of the local authority has reviewed the citation
  2 35 and any relevant recorded images produced by the system.
  3  1    d.  The amount of the fine or civil penalty imposed by a
  3  2 citation resulting from the use of an automated traffic law
  3  3 enforcement system shall not exceed the amount of the fine for
  3  4 a scheduled violation under section 805.8A for the same or a
  3  5 similar violation of this chapter.
  3  6    e.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  3  7 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  3  8 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  3  9 procedures for operating the system. A local authority,
  3 10 or another entity on a local authority's behalf, operating
  3 11 such a system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether
  3 12 the local authority or entity successfully performed the
  3 13 manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The local
  3 14 authority or entity shall also perform a weekly calibration
  3 15 check of the system, and documentation of the calibration check
  3 16 shall be retained by the local authority or entity. The log
  3 17 and documentation of the calibration checks shall be admissible
  3 18 in any court proceeding related to a violation of section
  3 19 321.257 or 321.285.
  3 20    f.  The department shall adopt rules to administer this
  3 21 subsection, including but not limited to rules relating to the
  3 22 size and location of signage advising drivers that an automated
  3 23 traffic law enforcement system is in place.
  3 24    3.  All moneys collected by a local authority from
  3 25 citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  3 26 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary
  3 27 for the installation, operation, and maintenance of the
  3 28 automated traffic law enforcement system, shall be deposited
  3 29 in the account or accounts maintained by the local authority
  3 30 for moneys appropriated to the local authority from the

  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.

  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing

  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of

  3  6    e.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  3  7 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  3  8 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  3  9 procedures for operating the system. A local authority,
  3 10 or another entity on a local authority's behalf, operating
  3 11 such a system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether
  3 12 the local authority or entity successfully performed the
  3 13 manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The local

  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in

  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  3  5 similar violation of this chapter.
  3  6    e.  An automated traffic law enforcement system working
  3  7 in conjunction with a speed measuring device or official
  3  8 traffic=control signal shall comply with the generally accepted
  3  9 procedures for operating the system. A local authority,
  3 10 or another entity on a local authority's behalf, operating
  3 11 such a system shall maintain a monthly log detailing whether
  3 12 the local authority or entity successfully performed the
  3 13 manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The local
  3 14 authority or entity shall also perform a weekly calibration

  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a

  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or

  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.

  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in

  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local

  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
  5 29 the cities, as applicable. This provision does not apply to
  5 30 moneys collected for court costs or other associated costs,
  5 31 the criminal penalty surcharge, or the county enforcement
  5 32 surcharge.

  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).

  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,

  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated

  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in

  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly

  4  1                           EXPLANATION
  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill prohibits the department of transportation (DOT)
  4  5 from placing, operating, maintaining, or employing the use of
  4  6 any automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4  7    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another entity
  4  8 on a local authority's behalf, from operating an automated
  4  9 traffic law enforcement system without the approval of the DOT.
  4 10 The bill provides that the DOT shall approve the operation of
  4 11 an automated traffic law enforcement system only if the system
  4 12 is located in a documented high=crash or high=risk location
  4 13 at which there is a demonstrated safety need for the system.
  4 14 The bill requires the DOT to make such a determination about
  4 15 a location based on the volume of traffic, the history of
  4 16 motor vehicle accidents, the frequency and type of traffic
  4 17 violations, the risk to peace officers employing traditional
  4 18 traffic enforcement methods, and any other safety criteria
  4 19 deemed appropriate by the DOT.  In addition, the bill requires
  4 20 the DOT to separately approve each location at which a local
  4 21 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  4 22 operates a mobile automated traffic law enforcement system.
  4 23 These provisions of the bill do not apply to an automated
  4 24 traffic law enforcement system approved by the DOT and in
  4 25 operation prior to January 1, 2017.
  4 26    The bill prohibits a local authority, or another entity on a
  4 27 local authority's behalf, from operating an automated traffic
  4 28 law enforcement system without posting appropriate signage in
  4 29 clear and present view of passing drivers in advance of the
  4 30 location where the system is in use.
  4 31    The bill also prohibits a local authority, or another
  4 32 entity on a local authority's behalf, from issuing a citation
  4 33 resulting from the use of an automated traffic law enforcement
  4 34 system until a peace officer of the local authority has
  4 35 reviewed the citation and any relevant recorded images produced
  5  1 by the system.
  5  2    In addition, the bill prohibits the amount of the fine or
  5  3 civil penalty imposed by a citation resulting from the use of
  5  4 an automated traffic law enforcement system from exceeding the
  5  5 amount of the fine for a scheduled violation under Code section
  5  6 805.8A for the same or a similar violation.
  5  7    The bill provides that an automated traffic law enforcement
  5  8 system working in conjunction with a speed measuring device or
  5  9 official traffic=control signal must comply with the generally
  5 10 accepted procedures for operating the system. A local
  5 11 authority, or another entity on a local authority's behalf,
  5 12 operating such a system must maintain a monthly log detailing
  5 13 whether the local authority or entity successfully performed
  5 14 the manufacturer=specified self=test of the system. The bill
  5 15 requires a local authority or entity to also perform a weekly
  5 16 calibration check of the system, and requires documentation of
  5 17 the calibration check to be retained by the local authority or
  5 18 entity. The bill specifies that the log and documentation of
  5 19 the calibration checks are admissible in any court proceeding
  5 20 related to a violation of Code section 321.257 (official
  5 21 traffic=control signals) or 321.285 (speed restrictions).
  5 22    The bill requires all moneys collected by a local authority
  5 23 from citations issued as a result of the use of an automated
  5 24 traffic law enforcement system, less the amount necessary for
  5 25 the installation, operation, and maintenance of the system,
  5 26 to be deposited in the account or accounts maintained by the
  5 27 local authority for moneys appropriated to the local authority
  5 28 from the secondary road fund or street construction fund of
