department
of

each
six-month
period
of
the

bill
excludes
from
the
fee
transfer
requirements
29


registrations
by
contractors
that
are
exempt
from
the
30


registration
fee
pursuant
to
Code
section
91C.1.
31

bill
also
strikes
language
providing

$25,000
surety

bonds
filed
with
the
division
of
labor
services
as
provided
in
33


Code
section
