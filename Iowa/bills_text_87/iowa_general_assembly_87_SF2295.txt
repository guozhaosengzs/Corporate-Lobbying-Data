  2 13                           EXPLANATION
  2 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 16    This bill relates to feticide. The bill amends Code
  2 17 section 707.7 (feticide) to specify when feticide or attempted
  2 18 feticide is committed.  The bill provides that any person who
  2 19 intentionally terminates a human pregnancy, with the knowledge
  2 20 and voluntary consent of the pregnant person, after the
  2 21 pregnancy reaches one week postfertilization, where death of
  2 22 the fetus results, commits feticide. Feticide is a class "C"
  2 23 felony. A class "C" felony is punishable by confinement for no
  2 24 more than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more
  2 25 than $10,000.  Under existing law, feticide is committed when
  2 26 a person intentionally terminates a human pregnancy, with the
  2 27 knowledge and voluntary consent of the pregnant person, after
  2 28 the end of the second trimester of the pregnancy, where death
  2 29 of the fetus results.
  2 30    The bill provides that any person who attempts to
  2 31 intentionally terminate a human pregnancy, with the knowledge
  2 32 and voluntary consent of the pregnant person, after the
  2 33 pregnancy reaches one week postfertilization, where death
  2 34 of the fetus does not result, commits attempted feticide.
  2 35 Attempted feticide is a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony
  3  1 is punishable by confinement for no more than five years and a
  3  2 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500. Under existing
  3  3 law, attempted feticide is committed when a person attempts to
  3  4 intentionally terminate a human pregnancy, with the knowledge
  3  5 and voluntary consent of the pregnant person, after the end of
  3  6 the second trimester of the pregnancy, where death of the fetus
  3  7 does not result.
  3  8    The bill also provides that the feticide provisions do not
  3  9 apply to the termination of a human pregnancy performed by a
  3 10 physician licensed in this state when in the best clinical
  3 11 judgment of the physician the termination is performed to
  3 12 preserve the life, but not the health, of the pregnant person
  3 13 or of the fetus or to avert a serious risk to the pregnant
  3 14 person of a substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
  3 15 a major bodily function and every reasonable medical effort not
  3 16 inconsistent with preserving the life of the pregnant person is
  3 17 made to preserve the life of a viable fetus.
  3 18    Additionally, the feticide provisions do not apply to
  3 19 the termination of a human pregnancy between fertilization
  3 20 and until the pregnancy reaches 24 weeks postfertilization,
  3 21 performed by a physician licensed in the state when in the best
  3 22 clinical judgment of the physician the human pregnancy has a
  3 23 fetal anomaly incompatible with life.  The bill defines "fetal
  3 24 anomaly incompatible with life" as a fetal condition diagnosed
  3 25 in utero that, if the pregnancy results in a live birth, will
  3 26 with reasonable certainty result in the death of the child
  3 27 or will result in requiring the provision of life=sustaining
  3 28 procedures to the child after the child's birth and for the
  3 29 duration of the child's life.
  3 30    The bill also repeals Code chapter 146A (abortion
  3 31 prerequisites) and Code chapter 146B (abortion == limitations
  3 32 and prerequisites) which are inconsistent with the feticide
  3 33 provisions in the bill.

  3 25 in utero that, if the pregnancy results in a live birth, will
  3 26 with reasonable certainty result in the death of the child
  3 27 or will result in requiring the provision of life=sustaining
  3 28 procedures to the child after the child's birth and for the
