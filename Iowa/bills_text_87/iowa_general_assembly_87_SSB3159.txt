lease,
13


rental,
or
advertisement
of
a

if

certified
by
16


a
certification
body
accredited

17


standards
institute

process
is
followed.

In
lieu
of
certification
by
a
certification
body
accredited
by
19


the
American
national
standards
institute,
the
manufacturer
may
20


rely
upon
the
manufacturer’s
own
test
data
after
approval
of
21


the
data
by
an
acceptable
third-party
evaluator,
after
a
review
22


by
the
department
of
public
health
of
the
qualifications
of
the
23


third-party

If
such
24


a
third-party
evaluator
finds
that
the
manufacturer’s
test
data
25


is
reliable,
adequate,
and
fairly
presented,

26


may
rely
upon
that
data

the
