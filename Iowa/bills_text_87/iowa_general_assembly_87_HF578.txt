 14 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  2    This bill relates to adoption and termination of parental
 15  3 rights.  The bill defines "adoption service provider" to
 15  4 include a licensed child=placing agency or a licensed attorney.
 15  5 The bill eliminates the definition of and the use of the term
 15  6 "independent placement" relative to termination of parental
 15  7 rights and adoption proceedings, thereby only allowing adoption
 15  8 service providers and the department of human services (DHS) to
 15  9 make placements of minor children for the purposes of adoption.
 15 10 The bill also defines "certified adoption investigator", for
 15 11 the purposes of termination of parental rights and adoption
 15 12 proceedings, replacing the term "investigator" which did not
 15 13 require certification or approval of such investigators by
 15 14 the department of human services. The bill makes conforming
 15 15 changes throughout the Code to reflect the new definitions,
 15 16 including relative to allowable tax deductions from net income.
 15 17    The bill clarifies that the one certified copy of the
 15 18 adoption decree to the petitioner, and the one copy of any
 15 19 adoption decree to DHS, an adoption service provider, and the
 15 20 state registrar of vital statistics, currently required to be
 15 21 provided by the clerk of the court, are to be provided at no
 15 22 charge.
 15 23    The bill requires reporting of expenditures and limitations
 15 24 on payment of only allowable expenditures relating to
 15 25 termination of parental rights similar to those requirements
 15 26 currently in place for adoption. As with adoptions, the bill
 15 27 prohibits a biological parent from receiving any thing of value
 15 28 as a result of the biological parent terminating the parent's
 15 29 parental rights, unless that thing of value is an allowable
 15 30 expense as provided in the bill.  Any person assisting in any
 15 31 way with the termination of parental rights is prohibited
 15 32 from charging a fee which is more than usual, necessary, and
 15 33 commensurate with the services rendered. If the biological
 15 34 parent receives any prohibited thing of value, if a person
 15 35 gives a prohibited thing of value, or if a person charges a
 16  1 prohibited fee, the person is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 16  2    As with an adoption petitioner, the bill also requires a
 16  3 termination of parental rights petitioner to file with the
 16  4 juvenile court or court, prior to the termination hearing, a
 16  5 full accounting of all disbursements of any thing of value
 16  6 paid or agreed to be paid by or on behalf of the petitioner
 16  7 or intended adoptive parent in connection with the petitioned
 16  8 termination.  The accounting is to be made by a report
 16  9 prescribed by the juvenile court or court and signed and
 16 10 verified by the petitioner. The report is required to be
 16 11 accompanied by documentation of all disbursements made prior to
 16 12 the date of filing of the report.  The bill specifies allowable
 16 13 expenses similar to those allowed relative to an adoption
 16 14 proceeding.
 16 15    Additionally, the bill provides that all payments for
 16 16 allowable expenses shall be made through the adoption
 16 17 service provider and that the adoption service provider shall
 16 18 deposit all funds received into an escrow account.  The bill
 16 19 specifies that such escrow funds shall not be commingled with
 16 20 other revenues or expense accounts of the adoption service
 16 21 provider and separate accounting shall be maintained for each
 16 22 prospective adoptive parent whose funds are deposited in the
 16 23 escrow account.  Any escrow funds not disbursed by the adoption
 16 24 service provider for the benefit of the designated biological
 16 25 parent shall be returned to the prospective adoptive parents
 16 26 with a full accounting of all deposits and disbursements.
 16 27 The bill provides that if the adoption service provider is a
 16 28 licensed attorney, use of the attorney's state=sanctioned trust
 16 29 account shall satisfy the requirement relative to the escrow
 16 30 account.
 16 31    As with similar provisions relating to payment of allowable
 16 32 expenses under an adoption proceeding, any payments for
 16 33 allowable expenses relative to a termination of parental rights
 16 34 proceeding shall not be made to a biological parent, but
 16 35 instead shall be made directly to the provider of the service,
 17  1 product, or other activity to which the allowable expense
 17  2 is attributable, if applicable. The provisions relating
 17  3 to allowable expenditures and reporting do not apply in a
 17  4 stepparent adoption.
 17  5    The bill directs that, as in an adoption proceeding, the
 17  6 juvenile court or court shall review the expenditure report
 17  7 prior to the termination hearing and shall include findings
 17  8 regarding the allowance or disallowance of any disbursements or
 17  9 projected disbursements in the termination order.
 17 10    The bill also includes provisions relating to prohibited
 17 11 practices relating to termination procedures.  The bill amends
 17 12 and increases the penalty from a simple misdemeanor to a
 17 13 serious misdemeanor for the existing prohibition against a
 17 14 person who signs or accepts a release of custody prior to the
 17 15 expiration of the required 72=hour period.  The bill includes
 17 16 prohibited practices, the violation of which is a serious
 17 17 misdemeanor for a first offense and a class "C" felony for any
 17 18 second or subsequent violation.  The bill also includes similar
 17 19 prohibited practices relative to an adoption proceeding.
 17 20    A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for
 17 21 no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 17 22 than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 17 23 by confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at
 17 24 least $315 but not more than $1,875. A class "C" felony is
 17 25 punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine
 17 26 of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 17 27    The bill also includes in the definition of a fraudulent
 17 28 practice under Code section 714.8, a person, knowingly, by
 17 29 deception and with intent to defraud another person, represents
 17 30 that the child expected as the result of that person's
 17 31 pregnancy or the pregnancy of another person may be available
 17 32 for adoption.  The bill also makes this fraudulent practice a
 17 33 fraudulent practice in the third degree, which is an aggravated
 17 34 misdemeanor.  An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by
 17 35 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
 18  1 $625 but not more than $6,250.

 16 21 provider and separate accounting shall be maintained for each
 16 22 prospective adoptive parent whose funds are deposited in the
 16 23 escrow account.  Any escrow funds not disbursed by the adoption
 16 24 service provider for the benefit of the designated biological

 15 32 from charging a fee which is more than usual, necessary, and
 15 33 commensurate with the services rendered. If the biological
 15 34 parent receives any prohibited thing of value, if a person
 15 35 gives a prohibited thing of value, or if a person charges a

 16 16 allowable expenses shall be made through the adoption
 16 17 service provider and that the adoption service provider shall
 16 18 deposit all funds received into an escrow account.  The bill
 16 19 specifies that such escrow funds shall not be commingled with
 16 20 other revenues or expense accounts of the adoption service
 16 21 provider and separate accounting shall be maintained for each
 16 22 prospective adoptive parent whose funds are deposited in the
 16 23 escrow account.  Any escrow funds not disbursed by the adoption
 16 24 service provider for the benefit of the designated biological

 15 23    The bill requires reporting of expenditures and limitations
 15 24 on payment of only allowable expenditures relating to
 15 25 termination of parental rights similar to those requirements

 15 27 prohibits a biological parent from receiving any thing of value
 15 28 as a result of the biological parent terminating the parent's
 15 29 parental rights, unless that thing of value is an allowable
 15 30 expense as provided in the bill.  Any person assisting in any
 15 31 way with the termination of parental rights is prohibited
 15 32 from charging a fee which is more than usual, necessary, and
 15 33 commensurate with the services rendered. If the biological
 15 34 parent receives any prohibited thing of value, if a person
 15 35 gives a prohibited thing of value, or if a person charges a
 16  1 prohibited fee, the person is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 16  2    As with an adoption petitioner, the bill also requires a
 16  3 termination of parental rights petitioner to file with the

 16  5 full accounting of all disbursements of any thing of value
 16  6 paid or agreed to be paid by or on behalf of the petitioner
 16  7 or intended adoptive parent in connection with the petitioned
 16  8 termination.  The accounting is to be made by a report
 16  9 prescribed by the juvenile court or court and signed and
 16 10 verified by the petitioner. The report is required to be
 16 11 accompanied by documentation of all disbursements made prior to
 16 12 the date of filing of the report.  The bill specifies allowable
 16 13 expenses similar to those allowed relative to an adoption
 16 14 proceeding.
 16 15    Additionally, the bill provides that all payments for
 16 16 allowable expenses shall be made through the adoption
 16 17 service provider and that the adoption service provider shall
 16 18 deposit all funds received into an escrow account.  The bill
 16 19 specifies that such escrow funds shall not be commingled with
 16 20 other revenues or expense accounts of the adoption service
 16 21 provider and separate accounting shall be maintained for each
 16 22 prospective adoptive parent whose funds are deposited in the
 16 23 escrow account.  Any escrow funds not disbursed by the adoption
 16 24 service provider for the benefit of the designated biological
 16 25 parent shall be returned to the prospective adoptive parents
 16 26 with a full accounting of all deposits and disbursements.
 16 27 The bill provides that if the adoption service provider is a

 16 35 instead shall be made directly to the provider of the service,
 17  1 product, or other activity to which the allowable expense
 17  2 is attributable, if applicable. The provisions relating
 17  3 to allowable expenditures and reporting do not apply in a

 17  5    The bill directs that, as in an adoption proceeding, the
 17  6 juvenile court or court shall review the expenditure report
 17  7 prior to the termination hearing and shall include findings
 17  8 regarding the allowance or disallowance of any disbursements or
 17  9 projected disbursements in the termination order.
 17 10    The bill also includes provisions relating to prohibited
 17 11 practices relating to termination procedures.  The bill amends
 17 12 and increases the penalty from a simple misdemeanor to a
 17 13 serious misdemeanor for the existing prohibition against a
 17 14 person who signs or accepts a release of custody prior to the
 17 15 expiration of the required 72=hour period.  The bill includes
 17 16 prohibited practices, the violation of which is a serious
 17 17 misdemeanor for a first offense and a class "C" felony for any
 17 18 second or subsequent violation.  The bill also includes similar
 17 19 prohibited practices relative to an adoption proceeding.
 17 20    A simple misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for
 17 21 no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more
 17 22 than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is punishable
 17 23 by confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at
 17 24 least $315 but not more than $1,875. A class "C" felony is
 17 25 punishable by confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine
 17 26 of at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 17 27    The bill also includes in the definition of a fraudulent
 17 28 practice under Code section 714.8, a person, knowingly, by
 17 29 deception and with intent to defraud another person, represents
 17 30 that the child expected as the result of that person's
 17 31 pregnancy or the pregnancy of another person may be available
 17 32 for adoption.  The bill also makes this fraudulent practice a
 17 33 fraudulent practice in the third degree, which is an aggravated
 17 34 misdemeanor.  An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by
 17 35 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
 18  1 $625 but not more than $6,250.
