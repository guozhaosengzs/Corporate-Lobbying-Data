  5 24                           EXPLANATION
  5 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 27    This bill relates to consumer security freezes and personal
  5 28 information security breach protection.
  5 29    Current law permits a consumer to submit a request for a
  5 30 security freeze via certified mail. The bill expands the
  5 31 methods permitted for a consumer to submit a request for
  5 32 a security freeze to allow such requests to be submitted
  5 33 via first=class mail, telephone, facsimile, secure internet
  5 34 connection, secure electronic mail, or other secure electronic
  5 35 contact method.
  6  1 The bill reduces the number of days by which a consumer
  6  2 reporting agency must commence a security freeze after
  6  3 receiving a request from five to three business days. The bill
  6  4 also reduces the number of days by which a consumer reporting
  6  5 agency must send written confirmation to a consumer after
  6  6 commencing a security freeze from ten to three business days.
  6  7    The bill provides that if a consumer requests a security
  6  8 freeze from a consumer reporting agency that compiles and
  6  9 maintains files on a nationwide basis, as defined in the bill,
  6 10 the consumer may request to have the security freeze applied to
  6 11 any other similar consumer reporting agency.
  6 12    The bill requires consumer reporting agencies to develop
  6 13 procedures to expedite the receipt and processing of security
  6 14 freeze suspension requests received via the same methods
  6 15 permitted for consumers to submit such requests. The bill
  6 16 requires a consumer reporting agency to commence a security
  6 17 freeze suspension within 15 minutes after receiving a request
  6 18 through telephone, facsimile, secure internet connection,
  6 19 secure electronic mail, or other secure electronic contact
  6 20 method.
  6 21    The bill prohibits consumer reporting agencies from charging
  6 22 fees to consumers for providing any service pursuant to Code
  6 23 chapter 714G, including but not limited to placing, removing,
  6 24 temporarily suspending, or reinstating a security freeze. The
  6 25 bill also prohibits consumer reporting agencies from charging
  6 26 fees for placing or removing a protected consumer security
  6 27 freeze pursuant to Code section 714G.8A.  The bill removes
  6 28 several references to payment of fees in Code chapter 714G.
  6 29    The bill also modifies various provisions relating to
  6 30 personal information security breach protection in Code
  6 31 chapter 715C.  The bill expands the definition of "breach of
  6 32 security" to include the reasonable belief of unauthorized
  6 33 acquisition of personal information. However, the bill removes
  6 34 the unauthorized acquisition of personal information that was
  6 35 transferred from computerized form to another medium from
  7  1 the definition of "breach of security". The definition of
  7  2 "encryption" is modified to mean the use of an algorithmic
  7  3 process pursuant to accepted industry standards.
  7  4    The bill exempts from the consumer notification requirements
  7  5 persons who are subject to and comply with specified federal
  7  6 health information laws.
  7  7    Current law requires a person who owns or licenses personal
  7  8 information that is subject to a breach of security requiring
  7  9 notification to more than 500 consumers in the state, as
  7 10 required by Code section 715C.2, to give written notice of the
  7 11 breach of security to the director of the consumer protection
  7 12 division of the office of the attorney general within five
  7 13 business days after giving notice of the security breach to any
  7 14 consumer. The bill removes language stating that a person give
  7 15 such written notice following the discovery of the breach or
  7 16 receipt of notification.

  5 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 27    This bill relates to consumer security freezes and personal
  5 28 information security breach protection.
  5 29    Current law permits a consumer to submit a request for a
  5 30 security freeze via certified mail. The bill expands the
  5 31 methods permitted for a consumer to submit a request for
  5 32 a security freeze to allow such requests to be submitted
  5 33 via first=class mail, telephone, facsimile, secure internet
  5 34 connection, secure electronic mail, or other secure electronic
  5 35 contact method.
  6  1 The bill reduces the number of days by which a consumer
  6  2 reporting agency must commence a security freeze after
  6  3 receiving a request from five to three business days. The bill
  6  4 also reduces the number of days by which a consumer reporting
  6  5 agency must send written confirmation to a consumer after
  6  6 commencing a security freeze from ten to three business days.
  6  7    The bill provides that if a consumer requests a security
  6  8 freeze from a consumer reporting agency that compiles and
  6  9 maintains files on a nationwide basis, as defined in the bill,
  6 10 the consumer may request to have the security freeze applied to
  6 11 any other similar consumer reporting agency.
  6 12    The bill requires consumer reporting agencies to develop
  6 13 procedures to expedite the receipt and processing of security
  6 14 freeze suspension requests received via the same methods
  6 15 permitted for consumers to submit such requests. The bill
  6 16 requires a consumer reporting agency to commence a security
  6 17 freeze suspension within 15 minutes after receiving a request
  6 18 through telephone, facsimile, secure internet connection,
  6 19 secure electronic mail, or other secure electronic contact
  6 20 method.
  6 21    The bill prohibits consumer reporting agencies from charging
  6 22 fees to consumers for providing any service pursuant to Code
  6 23 chapter 714G, including but not limited to placing, removing,
  6 24 temporarily suspending, or reinstating a security freeze. The
  6 25 bill also prohibits consumer reporting agencies from charging
  6 26 fees for placing or removing a protected consumer security
  6 27 freeze pursuant to Code section 714G.8A.  The bill removes
  6 28 several references to payment of fees in Code chapter 714G.
  6 29    The bill also modifies various provisions relating to
  6 30 personal information security breach protection in Code
  6 31 chapter 715C.  The bill expands the definition of "breach of
  6 32 security" to include the reasonable belief of unauthorized
  6 33 acquisition of personal information. However, the bill removes
  6 34 the unauthorized acquisition of personal information that was
  6 35 transferred from computerized form to another medium from
  7  1 the definition of "breach of security". The definition of
  7  2 "encryption" is modified to mean the use of an algorithmic
  7  3 process pursuant to accepted industry standards.
  7  4    The bill exempts from the consumer notification requirements
  7  5 persons who are subject to and comply with specified federal
  7  6 health information laws.
  7  7    Current law requires a person who owns or licenses personal
  7  8 information that is subject to a breach of security requiring
  7  9 notification to more than 500 consumers in the state, as
  7 10 required by Code section 715C.2, to give written notice of the
  7 11 breach of security to the director of the consumer protection
  7 12 division of the office of the attorney general within five
  7 13 business days after giving notice of the security breach to any
  7 14 consumer. The bill removes language stating that a person give
