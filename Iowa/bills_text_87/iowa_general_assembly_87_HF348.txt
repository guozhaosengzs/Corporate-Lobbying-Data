  1 14    c.  "Originating site" means the site at which a patient

  1 22 provide appropriate follow=up health care services, when
  1 23 necessary, at medically necessary intervals.
  1 24    (2)  The health care professional personally knows the

  1 29    (3)  The health care services provided via telehealth are
  1 30 provided by a health care professional in consultation with,
  1 31 or upon referral by, another health care professional who has
  1 32 an ongoing relationship with the patient and who has agreed to
  1 33 supervise the patient's treatment, including follow=up health

  2 15 treatment, or therapeutic assistance in the provision of
  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera

  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:

  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under

  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:
  4 13    (1)  Individual or group accident and sickness insurance
  4 14 providing coverage on an expense=incurred basis.
  4 15    (2)  An individual or group hospital or medical service
  4 16 contract issued pursuant to chapter 509, 514, or 514A.
  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.
  4 24    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified

  4 26 indemnity, credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic
  4 27 hospital, and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined
  4 28 by the commissioner, disability income insurance coverage,
  4 29 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance,
  4 30 workers' compensation or similar insurance, or automobile
  4 31 medical payment insurance.
  4 32    4.  The commissioner of insurance shall adopt rules pursuant
  4 33 to chapter 17A as necessary to administer this section.
  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the

  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for

  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:
  4 13    (1)  Individual or group accident and sickness insurance
  4 14 providing coverage on an expense=incurred basis.
  4 15    (2)  An individual or group hospital or medical service
  4 16 contract issued pursuant to chapter 509, 514, or 514A.
  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.
  4 24    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified

  4 28 by the commissioner, disability income insurance coverage,
  4 29 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance,
  4 30 workers' compensation or similar insurance, or automobile
  4 31 medical payment insurance.

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.
  4 24    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified
  4 25 disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement
  4 26 indemnity, credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  1 29    (3)  The health care services provided via telehealth are
  1 30 provided by a health care professional in consultation with,
  1 31 or upon referral by, another health care professional who has

  2  6    e.  "Remote patient monitoring" means using telehealth to
  2  7 enable the health care professional to monitor and manage a
  2  8 patient's medical, functional, and environmental needs if such
  2  9 needs can be appropriately met through telehealth intervention.

  2 12 or between a referring health care professional and a medical
  2 13 specialist at a distant site, supported by telecommunications
  2 14 technology for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 15 treatment, or therapeutic assistance in the provision of
  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.
  2 21    g.  "Telehealth" includes the use of real=time, interactive
  2 22 audio or video telecommunications or electronic technology,
  2 23 remote patient monitoring, or store=and=forward technology by
  2 24 a health care professional to deliver health care services

  2 31    2.  a.  Notwithstanding the uniformity of treatment
  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing

  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same

  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to

  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.

  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.

  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for

  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules

  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.

  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under

  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered

  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:

  4 16 contract issued pursuant to chapter 509, 514, or 514A.
  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.
  2 21    g.  "Telehealth" includes the use of real=time, interactive

  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing

  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules

  2 15 treatment, or therapeutic assistance in the provision of
  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.
  2 21    g.  "Telehealth" includes the use of real=time, interactive
  2 22 audio or video telecommunications or electronic technology,

  2 26 professional, for the purposes of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 27 treatment, transfer of medical data, or exchange of medical

  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage

  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as

  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or

  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for

  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth

  2 12 or between a referring health care professional and a medical
  2 13 specialist at a distant site, supported by telecommunications
  2 14 technology for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 15 treatment, or therapeutic assistance in the provision of
  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.

  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient

  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing

  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:
  4 13    (1)  Individual or group accident and sickness insurance
  4 14 providing coverage on an expense=incurred basis.
  4 15    (2)  An individual or group hospital or medical service
  4 16 contract issued pursuant to chapter 509, 514, or 514A.
  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.

  4 31 medical payment insurance.
  4 32    4.  The commissioner of insurance shall adopt rules pursuant

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:

  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing

  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  1 22 provide appropriate follow=up health care services, when
  1 23 necessary, at medically necessary intervals.
  1 24    (2)  The health care professional personally knows the
  1 25 patient and the patient's relevant health status through an
  1 26 ongoing personal or professional relationship, and is available
  1 27 to provide appropriate follow=up health care services, when
  1 28 necessary, at medically necessary intervals.
  1 29    (3)  The health care services provided via telehealth are
  1 30 provided by a health care professional in consultation with,
  1 31 or upon referral by, another health care professional who has
  1 32 an ongoing relationship with the patient and who has agreed to
  1 33 supervise the patient's treatment, including follow=up health
  1 34 care services.
  1 35    (4)  An on=call or cross=coverage arrangement exists between
  2  1 the health care professional and the patient's regular treating

  2  3    (5)  A professional relationship exists in other
  2  4 circumstances as defined by rule of the professional board
  2  5 having jurisdiction over the health care professional.
  2  6    e.  "Remote patient monitoring" means using telehealth to
  2  7 enable the health care professional to monitor and manage a
  2  8 patient's medical, functional, and environmental needs if such
  2  9 needs can be appropriately met through telehealth intervention.
  2 10    f.  "Store=and=forward technology" means the asynchronous
  2 11 communications between a patient and a health care professional
  2 12 or between a referring health care professional and a medical
  2 13 specialist at a distant site, supported by telecommunications
  2 14 technology for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 15 treatment, or therapeutic assistance in the provision of
  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.
  2 21    g.  "Telehealth" includes the use of real=time, interactive
  2 22 audio or video telecommunications or electronic technology,
  2 23 remote patient monitoring, or store=and=forward technology by
  2 24 a health care professional to deliver health care services
  2 25 to a patient within the scope of practice of the health care
  2 26 professional, for the purposes of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 27 treatment, transfer of medical data, or exchange of medical
  2 28 education information.  "Telehealth" does not include an
  2 29 audio=only telephone call, electronic mail message, or
  2 30 facsimile transmission.
  2 31    2.  a.  Notwithstanding the uniformity of treatment
  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:

  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.
  4 24    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified

  4 27 hospital, and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined

  2 11 communications between a patient and a health care professional
  2 12 or between a referring health care professional and a medical
  2 13 specialist at a distant site, supported by telecommunications
  2 14 technology for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 15 treatment, or therapeutic assistance in the provision of
  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.
  2 21    g.  "Telehealth" includes the use of real=time, interactive
  2 22 audio or video telecommunications or electronic technology,
  2 23 remote patient monitoring, or store=and=forward technology by
  2 24 a health care professional to deliver health care services
  2 25 to a patient within the scope of practice of the health care

  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:
  4 13    (1)  Individual or group accident and sickness insurance
  4 14 providing coverage on an expense=incurred basis.
  4 15    (2)  An individual or group hospital or medical service
  4 16 contract issued pursuant to chapter 509, 514, or 514A.
  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.
  4 24    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified

  4 27 hospital, and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined
  4 28 by the commissioner, disability income insurance coverage,
  4 29 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance,
  4 30 workers' compensation or similar insurance, or automobile
  4 31 medical payment insurance.
  4 32    4.  The commissioner of insurance shall adopt rules pursuant
  4 33 to chapter 17A as necessary to administer this section.
  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  1 28 necessary, at medically necessary intervals.
  1 29    (3)  The health care services provided via telehealth are
  1 30 provided by a health care professional in consultation with,

  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as

  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or

  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,

  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  1 29    (3)  The health care services provided via telehealth are
  1 30 provided by a health care professional in consultation with,
  1 31 or upon referral by, another health care professional who has
  1 32 an ongoing relationship with the patient and who has agreed to

  2 14 technology for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation,

  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.

  2 24 a health care professional to deliver health care services
  2 25 to a patient within the scope of practice of the health care
  2 26 professional, for the purposes of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 27 treatment, transfer of medical data, or exchange of medical
  2 28 education information.  "Telehealth" does not include an
  2 29 audio=only telephone call, electronic mail message, or

  2 31    2.  a.  Notwithstanding the uniformity of treatment
  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the

  2 31    2.  a.  Notwithstanding the uniformity of treatment
  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual

  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:

  4 14 providing coverage on an expense=incurred basis.
  4 15    (2)  An individual or group hospital or medical service
  4 16 contract issued pursuant to chapter 509, 514, or 514A.
  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.

  4 28 by the commissioner, disability income insurance coverage,
  4 29 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance,

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  1 30 provided by a health care professional in consultation with,
  1 31 or upon referral by, another health care professional who has

  2  6    e.  "Remote patient monitoring" means using telehealth to

  2 10    f.  "Store=and=forward technology" means the asynchronous
  2 11 communications between a patient and a health care professional
  2 12 or between a referring health care professional and a medical
  2 13 specialist at a distant site, supported by telecommunications
  2 14 technology for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 15 treatment, or therapeutic assistance in the provision of
  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.
  2 21    g.  "Telehealth" includes the use of real=time, interactive

  2 25 to a patient within the scope of practice of the health care
  2 26 professional, for the purposes of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 27 treatment, transfer of medical data, or exchange of medical

  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan

  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under

  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,

  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules

  2  4 circumstances as defined by rule of the professional board
  2  5 having jurisdiction over the health care professional.

  2  9 needs can be appropriately met through telehealth intervention.
  2 10    f.  "Store=and=forward technology" means the asynchronous
  2 11 communications between a patient and a health care professional
  2 12 or between a referring health care professional and a medical
  2 13 specialist at a distant site, supported by telecommunications
  2 14 technology for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 15 treatment, or therapeutic assistance in the provision of
  2 16 care to the patient, including the transferring of medical
  2 17 data from one site to another through the use of a camera
  2 18 or similar device that records or stores an image that is
  2 19 sent or forwarded via telecommunications to another site for
  2 20 consultation.
  2 21    g.  "Telehealth" includes the use of real=time, interactive
  2 22 audio or video telecommunications or electronic technology,

  2 24 a health care professional to deliver health care services
  2 25 to a patient within the scope of practice of the health care
  2 26 professional, for the purposes of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 27 treatment, transfer of medical data, or exchange of medical
  2 28 education information.  "Telehealth" does not include an

  2 31    2.  a.  Notwithstanding the uniformity of treatment
  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under
  3 17 this section, all of the following shall apply:
  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.

  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an

  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for

  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a

  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.

  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be

  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider

  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be

  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to

  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,

  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for

  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a

  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:
  4 13    (1)  Individual or group accident and sickness insurance
  4 14 providing coverage on an expense=incurred basis.
  4 15    (2)  An individual or group hospital or medical service
  4 16 contract issued pursuant to chapter 509, 514, or 514A.
  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.

  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.
  4 24    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified
  4 25 disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement
  4 26 indemnity, credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,

  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for

  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a

  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing
  3 14 information of a generic nature, not specific to the individual
  3 15 patient.
  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under

  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or

  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a

  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.

  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,

  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a

  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth

  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  2 26 professional, for the purposes of diagnosis, consultation,
  2 27 treatment, transfer of medical data, or exchange of medical
  2 28 education information.  "Telehealth" does not include an
  2 29 audio=only telephone call, electronic mail message, or
  2 30 facsimile transmission.
  2 31    2.  a.  Notwithstanding the uniformity of treatment
  2 32 requirements of section 514C.6, a contract, policy, or plan
  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services
  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing

  3 16    3.  If health care coverage is provided for telehealth under

  3 18    a.  This section shall not be interpreted as preventing
  3 19 a third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  3 20 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  3 21 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,
  4 12 or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2018:
  4 13    (1)  Individual or group accident and sickness insurance
  4 14 providing coverage on an expense=incurred basis.
  4 15    (2)  An individual or group hospital or medical service
  4 16 contract issued pursuant to chapter 509, 514, or 514A.
  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.
  4 24    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified
  4 25 disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement
  4 26 indemnity, credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic
  4 27 hospital, and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined
  4 28 by the commissioner, disability income insurance coverage,
  4 29 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance,
  4 30 workers' compensation or similar insurance, or automobile
  4 31 medical payment insurance.
  4 32    4.  The commissioner of insurance shall adopt rules pursuant
  4 33 to chapter 17A as necessary to administer this section.

  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for

  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.
  3 13    (2)  The health care professional is only providing

  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  2 33 providing for third=party payment or prepayment for health,
  2 34 medical, or surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage
  2 35 for health care services provided as telehealth if the services
  3  1 would be covered if provided in person.  Health care services

  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a

  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a

  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public

  4 26 indemnity, credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic
  4 27 hospital, and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined
  4 28 by the commissioner, disability income insurance coverage,

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  3  2 provided  in=person or through telehealth shall be treated as
  3  3 equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  3  4    b.  Telehealth coverage shall only be provided pursuant
  3  5 to paragraph "a" if the health care professional providing
  3  6 telehealth at a distant site to a patient located at an
  3  7 originating site in this state has a professional relationship
  3  8 with the patient. However, a health care professional shall
  3  9 not be required to have a professional relationship with a
  3 10 patient if either of the following applies:
  3 11    (1)  In an emergency where the life or health of the patient
  3 12 is in danger or imminent danger.

  3 22 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  3 23 coinsurance applicable to in=person consultation for the same
  3 24 health care service. A third=party payment provider shall not
  3 25 impose annual or lifetime maximums on coverage of telehealth
  3 26 unless the annual or lifetime maximum applies in the aggregate
  3 27 to all items and health care services under the contract,
  3 28 policy, or plan.
  3 29    b.  This section shall not be interpreted to require a
  3 30 third=party payment provider to provide reimbursement for
  3 31 a health care service that is not a covered benefit or to
  3 32 reimburse a health care professional who is not a covered
  3 33 provider under the contract, policy, or plan.
  3 34    c.  This section shall not be interpreted to preclude a
  3 35 third=party payment provider from performing utilization review
  4  1 to determine the appropriateness of telehealth in the delivery
  4  2 of health care services if the determination is made in the
  4  3 same manner as those regarding the same health care service
  4  4 when delivered in person.
  4  5    d.  This section shall not be interpreted to authorize a
  4  6 third=party payment provider to require the use of telehealth
  4  7 when the health care professional determines use of telehealth
  4  8 is not appropriate.
  4  9    e.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the
  4 10 following classes of third=party payment provider contracts,
  4 11 policies, or plans delivered, issued for delivery, continued,

  4 17    (3)  An individual or group health maintenance organization
  4 18 contract regulated under chapter 514B.
  4 19    (4)  An individual or group Medicare supplemental policy,
  4 20 unless coverage pursuant to such policy is preempted by federal
  4 21 law.
  4 22    (5)  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  4 23 employees.
  4 24    f.  This section shall not apply to accident=only, specified
  4 25 disease, short=term hospital or medical, hospital confinement
  4 26 indemnity, credit, dental, vision, long=term care, basic
  4 27 hospital, and medical=surgical expense coverage as defined

  4 29 coverage issued as a supplement to liability insurance,

  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be

  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,

  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of

  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional

  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the

  4 34                           EXPLANATION
  4 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  2    This bill relates to health insurance coverage for
  5  3 telehealth.
  5  4    The bill provides definitions relative to telehealth
  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
  5 10 services are provided via telehealth if the services would be
  5 11 covered if provided in person. Health care services provided
  5 12 through in=person consultations or through telehealth shall be
  5 13 treated as equivalent services for the purposes of coverage.
  5 14 Telehealth coverage is only to be provided if the health
  5 15 care professional providing telehealth at a distant site to
  5 16 a patient located at an originating site in this state has a
  5 17 professional relationship with the patient. This requirement
  5 18 does not apply, however, in an emergency where the life or
  5 19 health of the patient is in danger or imminent danger; or if
  5 20 the health care professional is only providing information of a
  5 21 generic nature, not specific to the individual patient.
  5 22    The provision is not to be interpreted as preventing a
  5 23 third=party payment provider from imposing deductibles or
  5 24 copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service
  5 25 provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment, or
  5 26 coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment, or
  5 27 coinsurance applicable to an in=person consultation for the
  5 28 same health care service. The bill provides that a third=party
  5 29 payment provider shall not impose annual or lifetime maximums
  5 30 on coverage of telehealth unless the annual or lifetime maximum
  5 31 applies in the aggregate to all items and health care services
  5 32 under the contract, policy, or plan.
  5 33    The bill provides that the Code section is not to be
  5 34 interpreted to require a third=party payment provider to
  5 35 provide reimbursement for a health care service that is not
  6  1 a covered benefit or to reimburse a health care professional
  6  2 who is not a covered provider under the contract, policy,
  6  3 or plan; to preclude a third=party payment provider from
  6  4 performing utilization review to determine the appropriateness
  6  5 of telehealth in the delivery of health care services if the
  6  6 determination is made in the same manner as those regarding
  6  7 the same health care service when delivered in person; or to
  6  8 authorize a third=party payment provider to require the use of
  6  9 telehealth when the health care professional determines use of
  6 10 telehealth is not appropriate.
  6 11    The bill specifies the types of third=party payment provider
  6 12 contracts, policies, or plans to which the bill applies and
  6 13 those exempt from its application.
  6 14    The commissioner of insurance is directed to adopt rules
  6 15 pursuant to Code chapter 17A as necessary to administer the
  6 16 bill.

  5  5 and requires that a contract, policy, or plan providing for
  5  6 third=party payment or prepayment for health, medical, or
  5  7 surgical coverage benefits cover telehealth. On or after
  5  8 January 1, 2018, the contract, policy, or plan shall not
  5  9 deny coverage of telehealth services on the basis that the
