  9 12                           EXPLANATION
  9 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 15    This bill relates to the electronic prescribing of
  9 16 prescription drugs, including controlled substances. The
  9 17 bill requires all prescriptions for prescription drugs to
  9 18 transmitted to a pharmacy electronically, effective January
  9 19 1, 2020. The bill also requires prescriptions for controlled
  9 20 substances that are issued electronically to comply with
  9 21 federal law for the electronic transmittal of prescriptions
  9 22 for controlled substances. The bill provides exemptions
  9 23 from this requirement in certain circumstances and provides
  9 24 alternative methods for the transmittal of prescriptions in
  9 25 those circumstances and for prescriptions transmitted prior
  9 26 to January 1, 2020. The bill also allows a person subject to
  9 27 the requirements of the bill to petition the board of pharmacy
  9 28 for exemption from the requirements of the bill based on
  9 29 economic hardship, technical limitations, or other exceptional
  9 30 circumstances. The bill requires refills for prescription
  9 31 drugs and controlled substances to be transmitted in the same
  9 32 manner as required for initial prescriptions. The bill does
  9 33 not require that a pharmacist who receives a prescription in
  9 34 other than an electronic format to verify that the prescription
  9 35 is subject to an exception. However, the bill directs
 10  1 pharmacists to use their professional judgment in identifying
 10  2 violations.
 10  3    A practitioner who does not transmit a prescription
