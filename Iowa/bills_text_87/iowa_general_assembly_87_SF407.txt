  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    Under current law, Code section 321.276 prohibits the
  4  5 use of hand=held electronic communication devices to write,
  4  6 send, or read text messages while driving a motor vehicle.
  4  7 This bill expands that provision to prohibit any use of an
  4  8 electronic communication device while driving. An electronic
  4  9 communication device is a device capable of being used to
  4 10 compose, send, receive, or read an electronic message, and
  4 11 includes telephones, personal digital assistants, and portable
  4 12 or mobile computers, but does not include devices that are
  4 13 integrated into the vehicle. An electronic message is a
  4 14 self=contained piece of digital communication, whether verbal
  4 15 or written, that is designed or intended to be transmitted
  4 16 between electronic communication devices, and includes
  4 17 telephone calls, video calls, electronic mail, text messages,
  4 18 instant messages, and commands or requests to access an
  4 19 internet site.
  4 20    The bill includes in the prohibition the use of a global
  4 21 positioning system or navigation system on an electronic
  4 22 communication device, and exempts the use of an electronic
  4 23 communication device for the purpose of reporting an emergency
  4 24 situation, or by pressing a single button to initiate or
  4 25 terminate a voice communication.
  4 26    The bill eliminates the provision prohibiting a peace
  4 27 officer from stopping or detaining a person solely for a
  4 28 suspected violation of Code section 321.276, and makes a
  4 29 violation of Code section 321.276 a moving violation. Under
  4 30 current law, a moving violation can be considered for purposes
  4 31 of administrative suspension of a driver's license or to
  4 32 establish habitual offender status.
  4 33    The bill rewords the applicable scheduled fine provision to
  4 34 comply with the bill. The scheduled fine for a violation of
  4 35 Code section 321.276 remains $30. Under Code section 321.482A,
  5  1 if the violation causes a serious injury, a court could impose
  5  2 an additional fine of $500 or suspend the person's driver's
  5  3 license for not more than 90 days, or both. If the violation
  5  4 causes a death, a court could impose an additional fine of
  5  5 $1,000 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more
  5  6 than 180 days, or both.
