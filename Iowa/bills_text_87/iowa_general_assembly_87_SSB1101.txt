substance
testing
required

The
participant
has
repeatedly
violated
the

requirements
of

while
submitting
to

DIVISION
II
——
STATEWIDE
SOBRIETY
AND
DRUG
MONITORING
1


PROGRAM.
The
bill
directs
the
department
of
public
safety
2


(DPS)
to
establish
a
statewide
sobriety
and
drug
monitoring
3


program
that
is
available
24
hours
per
day,
seven
days
per
4


week.
Under
the
program,
a
court
or
governmental
entity,
as
5


a
condition
of
bond,
pretrial
release,
sentence,
probation,
6


parole,
or
a
temporary
restricted
license,
may
require
a
person
7


who
has
been
charged
with,
pled
guilty
to,
or
been
convicted
8


of
an
eligible
offense
to
abstain
from
alcohol
and
controlled
9


substances
for
a
period
of
time.
The
bill
provides
that
an
10


eligible
offense
is
a
criminal
offense
in
which
the
abuse
of
11


alcohol
or
a
controlled
substance
was
a
contributing
factor
12


in
the
commission
of
the
offense
as
determined
by
the
court
13


or
governmental
entity
of
the
participating
jurisdiction,
14


including
but
not
limited
to
a
first
offense
of
operating
15


while
intoxicated
where
the
person’s
alcohol
concentration
16


exceeded
.15
and
an
accident
resulting
in
personal
injury
or
17


property
damage
occurred,
and
a
second
or
subsequent
offense
18


of
operating
while
intoxicated.
19


The
program
requires
a
person
to
be
subject
to
testing
to
20


determine
whether
alcohol
or
a
controlled
substance
is
present
21


in
the
person’s
body
at
least
twice
per
day
at
a
central
22


location
where
an
immediate
sanction
can
be
applied.
Where
23


such
testing
creates
a
documented
hardship
or
is
geographically
24


impractical,
an
alternative
method
approved
by
DPS
may
be
used.
25


Hardship
or
geographic
impracticality
is
determined
by
26


documentation
and
consideration
of
whether
a
testing
device
is
27


available,
whether
the
participant
is
capable
of
paying
the
28


fees
and
costs
associated
with
the
testing
device,
whether
29


the
participant
is
capable
of
wearing
the
testing
device,
and
30


whether
the
participant
fails
to
qualify
for
testing
twice
31


per
day
because
the
participant
lives
in
a
rural
area,
the
32


participant’s
employment
requires
the
participant’s
presence
at
33


a
location
remote
from
the
testing
location,
or
the
participant
34


has
repeatedly
violated
the
requirements
of
the
program.
