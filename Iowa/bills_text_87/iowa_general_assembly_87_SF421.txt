 10 25    Sec. 10.   10 25    Sec. 10.   10 26    1.  A law enforcement officer or animal warden may rescue
 10 27 an animal from a stationary motor vehicle, including through
 10 28 the use of forced entrance, if the law enforcement officer
 10 29 or animal warden reasonably believes that the animal may
 10 30 be suffering distress due to exposure to extreme interior
 10 31 temperature or a lack of adequate ventilation.  The law
 10 32 enforcement officer's or animal warden's action is justified
 10 33 regardless of whether the law enforcement officer or animal
 10 34 warden observed indications of distress or whether the person
 10 35 could be charged with or convicted of committing a public
 11  1 offense.
 11  2    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal warden shall
 11  3 provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11  4 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11  5 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11  6 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11  7 be claimed.
 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance

 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.
       LSB 2385SV (1) 87
       da/nh
 10 27 an animal from a stationary motor vehicle, including through
 10 28 the use of forced entrance, if the law enforcement officer
 10 29 or animal warden reasonably believes that the animal may
 10 30 be suffering distress due to exposure to extreme interior
 10 31 temperature or a lack of adequate ventilation.  The law
 10 32 enforcement officer's or animal warden's action is justified
 10 33 regardless of whether the law enforcement officer or animal
 10 34 warden observed indications of distress or whether the person
 10 35 could be charged with or convicted of committing a public
 11  1 offense.
 11  2    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal warden shall
 11  3 provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11  4 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11  5 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11  6 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11  7 be claimed.
 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.

 11 18 3, shall not apply to this Act.

 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that

 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves

 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 10 29 or animal warden reasonably believes that the animal may
 10 30 be suffering distress due to exposure to extreme interior
 10 31 temperature or a lack of adequate ventilation.  The law
 10 32 enforcement officer's or animal warden's action is justified
 10 33 regardless of whether the law enforcement officer or animal
 10 34 warden observed indications of distress or whether the person
 10 35 could be charged with or convicted of committing a public
 11  1 offense.
 11  2    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal warden shall
 11  3 provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11  4 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11  5 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11  6 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11  7 be claimed.
 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.

 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that

 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury

 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 10 30 be suffering distress due to exposure to extreme interior
 10 31 temperature or a lack of adequate ventilation.  The law
 10 32 enforcement officer's or animal warden's action is justified
 10 33 regardless of whether the law enforcement officer or animal
 10 34 warden observed indications of distress or whether the person
 10 35 could be charged with or convicted of committing a public
 11  1 offense.
 11  2    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal warden shall
 11  3 provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11  4 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11  5 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11  6 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11  7 be claimed.
 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under

 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide

 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority

 10 32 enforcement officer's or animal warden's action is justified
 10 33 regardless of whether the law enforcement officer or animal
 10 34 warden observed indications of distress or whether the person
 10 35 could be charged with or convicted of committing a public
 11  1 offense.
 11  2    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal warden shall

 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.

 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires

 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11  1 offense.
 11  2    2.  The law enforcement officer or animal warden shall
 11  3 provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11  4 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11  5 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11  6 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11  7 be claimed.
 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an

 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three

 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11  7 be claimed.
 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining

 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11  3 provide written notice of the rescue to the animal's
 11  4 responsible party. This requirement is satisfied by placing
 11  5 the notice in a conspicuous place located within the motor
 11  6 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11  7 be claimed.
 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL

 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,

 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.

 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;

 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11  6 vehicle. The notice must state where the rescued animal may
 11  7 be claimed.
 11  8    3.  The local authority shall provide for the maintenance
 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.
 11 17    Sec. 11.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection

 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority

 11  9 of the rescued animal as if it were a threatened animal under
 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.
 11 17    Sec. 11.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
 11 18 3, shall not apply to this Act.
 11 19    Sec. 12.  REPEAL.  Section 717B.8, Code 2017, is repealed.

 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).

 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.

 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where

 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 10 section 717B.5. However, a dispositional proceeding under
 11 11 section 717B.4 is not required if within ten days after the
 11 12 date of the animal's rescue the responsible party claims the
 11 13 animal from the local authority.  In order to claim the animal,
 11 14 the responsible party must reimburse the local authority for
 11 15 all reasonable costs that accrued from rescuing and maintaining
 11 16 the animal.

 11 18 3, shall not apply to this Act.
 11 19    Sec. 12.  REPEAL.  Section 717B.8, Code 2017, is repealed.
 11 20                           EXPLANATION
 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.

 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two

 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority

 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.

 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury

 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more

 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites

 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves

 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished

 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are

 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury

 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality

 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.

 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that

 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period

 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)

 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.

 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that

 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated

 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that

 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,

 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making

 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two

 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide

 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves

 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more

 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality

 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,

 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the

 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.

 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A

 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 30 481A.42).
 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 31    The bill amends three different criminal offenses in Code
 11 32 chapter 717B, including animal abuse (Code section 717B.2),
 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 14  9 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 14 10 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 14 11 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 14 12 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 14 13 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 14 14 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide

 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.

 11 33 animal neglect (Code section 717B.3), and animal torture (Code
 11 34 section 717B.3A).  The bill creates two new criminal offenses
 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,
 12 23 water, or shelter, or torturing the animal.  The bill rewrites
 12 24 these requirements by requiring that an animal be furnished
 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing
 13 18 custody of an animal at a location in which the  person does
 13 19 not hold a legal or equitable interest.  There are exceptions
 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making
 13 21 arrangements for the care of the animal.  The  criminal penalty
 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.
 13 29    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ENDANGERMENT.  Animal
 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged
 13 32 period of extreme interior temperature or a long period
 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  3 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 14  4 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 14  5 named offenses.
 14  6    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 14  7 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 14  8 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 14 15 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 14 16 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 14 17    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 14 18 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 14 19 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 14 20 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 14 21 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 14 22 an animal.  In each case, the court's decision to issue an
 14 23 order is discretionary except under certain conditions.  A
 14 24 court order requiring an evaluation and treatment is mandatory
 14 25 for juveniles.  That order and the order prohibiting contact
 14 26 with animals is also mandatory if the offense is punishable as
 14 27 an aggravated misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court
 14 28 order, the  period of prohibition is for not less than three
 14 29 years.  For a mandatory court order, the period of prohibition
 14 30 is not less than 10 years.
 14 31    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS == AND LOCAL
 14 32 ANIMAL WARDENS.  The bill provides that a law enforcement
 14 33 officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff) or an animal
 14 34 warden (a person employed by local government to enforce the
 14 35 animal control laws) is authorized to rescue an animal from a
 15  1 motor vehicle based upon a reasonable belief that the animal
 15  2 may be suffering distress.  The officer or warden must provide
 15  3 a written notice of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal
 15  4 must be maintained as a rescued animal by the local authority
 15  5 until it is claimed or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 11 35 including animal abandonment (new Code section 717B.3B) and
 12  1 animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).  Under the
 12  2 bill, each of the offenses includes an enhanced penalty that
 12  3 applies to a convicted person who has previously committed any
 12  4 of the named offenses; committed injury or interference with a
 12  5 police service dog (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality
 12  6 (Code section 717C.1); or committed an offense involving an
 12  7 animal contest (Code section 717D.4).
 12  8    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE.  Animal abuse involves
 12  9 intentionally injuring an animal by violence or poisoning.  The
 12 10 bill replaces the intent element with that of acting knowingly
 12 11 or recklessly.  It also removes a provision that exempted
 12 12 a person who acted with the consent of the animal's owner.
 12 13 The bill reduces the penalty from an aggravated to a serious
 12 14 misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that does not cause
 12 15 an animal serious injury or death and retains the penalty of
 12 16 aggravated misdemeanor for committing animal abuse that causes
 12 17 an animal serious injury or death. The bill provides that the
 12 18 aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony
 12 19 if the person was previously convicted of one of the named
 12 20 offenses.
 12 21    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == NEGLECT.  Animal neglect
 12 22 involves failing to provide an animal with adequate food,

 12 25 with adequate supplies of nutritional food, access to potable
 12 26 water, adequate sanitary conditions,  ventilated shelter
 12 27 sufficient to provide the animal with protection from extreme
 12 28 weather conditions, and necessary veterinary care.   The bill
 12 29 eliminates the torture prohibition.  The bill retains the
 12 30 criminal penalty which is a simple misdemeanor.  However, the
 12 31 penalty is increased to a serious misdemeanor if the animal
 12 32 suffers an injury and to an aggravated misdemeanor if the
 12 33 animal suffers a serious injury or death.  In a case where
 12 34 the animal suffers a serious injury or death, the aggravated
 12 35 misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class "D" felony if the person
 13  1 was previously convicted of one of the named offenses.
 13  2    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == TORTURE.  Animal torture
 13  3 involves inflicting upon an animal severe physical pain with
 13  4 depraved or sadistic intent to cause prolonged suffering or
 13  5 death.  The bill eliminates the element of intent and requires
 13  6 that the act involve prolonged or repeated physical pain that
 13  7 results in prolonged suffering and serious injury or death.
 13  8 The bill replaces the current penalties for animal torture.  A
 13  9 person is no longer guilty of an aggravated misdemeanor for
 13 10 the first offense and a class "D" felony for a subsequent
 13 11 offense.  Instead, a person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 13 12 which is enhanced to a class "C" felony if the person was
 13 13 previously convicted of one of the named offenses.  The bill
 13 14 also eliminates a requirement that a person convicted of animal
 13 15 torture must submit to psychological evaluation and treatment.
 13 16    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES == ABANDONMENT.  Animal
 13 17 abandonment involves knowingly or recklessly relinquishing

 13 20 in cases of transferring ownership or custody or making

 13 22 is a simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to
 13 23 a serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 13 24 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 25 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
 13 26 or death, the aggravated misdemeanor may be enhanced to a class
 13 27 "D" felony if the person was previously convicted of one of the
 13 28 named offenses.

 13 30 endangerment involves confining an animal in a stationary motor
 13 31 vehicle in a manner that exposes the animal to a prolonged

 13 33 without adequate ventilation.  The criminal penalty is a
 13 34 simple misdemeanor. However, the penalty is increased to a
 13 35 serious misdemeanor if the animal suffers an injury and to an
 14  1 aggravated misdemeanor if the animal suffers a serious injury
 14  2 or death. In a case where the animal suffers a serious injury
