  3  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  6    This bill relates to permissible interest rates and charges
  3  7 for certain loans.
  3  8    Current law allows the superintendent of banking to
  3  9 establish the maximum rate of interest or charges for regulated
  3 10 loans subject to Code chapter 536 with unpaid principal
  3 11 balances of $10,000 or less. The bill increases this amount to
  3 12 $30,000. For loans with unpaid principal balances in excess
  3 13 of $30,000 (formerly $10,000), the maximum interest rate or
  3 14 charges a lender may charge remains the greater of the rate
  3 15 permitted in Code chapter 535 or the rate authorized for
  3 16 supervised financial organizations in Code chapter 537.
  3 17    Current law allows a supervised financial organization or
  3 18 mortgage lender to contract for and receive a finance charge
  3 19 not exceeding 21 percent per year on the unpaid balance of the
  3 20 amount financed for a consumer loan subject to Code chapter 537
  3 21 that is not pursuant to open=end credit. The bill provides
  3 22 that such finance charge may also include a service charge,
  3 23 collected in advance and equal to the lesser of 2 percent of
  3 24 the amount financed or $120, in addition to 21 percent per
  3 25 year on the unpaid balance of the consumer loan. A lender may
  3 26 contract for and receive a finance charge in excess of this
  3 27 amount if authorized by other provisions of the law. Under
  3 28 current law, the maximum finance charge amount for a consumer
  3 29 loan as provided in the bill also serves as the maximum amount
  3 30 for interest rates on certain consumer loans made by state
  3 31 credit unions (Code section 533.316), the maximum finance
  3 32 charge amount applicable to certain supervised loans (Code
  3 33 section 537.2308), and the maximum finance charge applicable
  3 34 to certain consumer credit transactions on refinancing (Code
  3 35 section 537.2504) and consolidation (Code section 537.2505).
  4  1 Additionally, current law allows a lender to contract for
  4  2 and receive a finance charge not exceeding 21 percent per
  4  3 year on the unpaid balance of the amount financed for a loan
  4  4 secured by a certificate of title to certain motor vehicles.
  4  5 The bill provides that such finance charge may also include a
  4  6 service charge, collected in advance and equal to the lesser
  4  7 of 2 percent of the amount financed or $120, in addition to 21
  4  8 percent per year on the unpaid balance of the consumer loan.
  4  9    The bill authorizes a creditor to contract for and receive,
  4 10 for an interest=bearing consumer credit transaction, a service
  4 11 charge in an amount not to exceed the lesser of 10 percent
  4 12 of the amount financed or $30. The bill provides that if a
  4 13 creditor has received such a service charge, the creditor
  4 14 shall not collect or retain a minimum charge upon prepayment
  4 15 as authorized under Code section 537.2510. The bill specifies
  4 16 that Code section 537.2510, relating to rebate upon prepayment,
  4 17 does not apply to service charges collected pursuant to the
  4 18 bill.
