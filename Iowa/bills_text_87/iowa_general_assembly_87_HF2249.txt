  2  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 10    This bill relates to the criminal offense of lascivious
  2 11 conduct with a minor or child.
  2 12    The bill defines "minor" to mean a person fourteen or fifteen
  2 13 years of age.

  2 15 minor when a person over 18 years of age who is in a position of
  2 16 authority over a minor performs any of the following acts with
  2 17 a minor, with or without consent, for the purpose of arousing
  2 18 or satisfying the sexual desires of either of them: fondle

  3  7 over 18 years of age who is in a position of authority over
