 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.

 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.

 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other

 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated

 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with

 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.

 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty

 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.

 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the

 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for

 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.
 15  8    The bill takes effect July 1, 2018.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation

 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of

 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any

 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of

 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any

 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the

 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to

 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial

 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the

 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,

 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of

 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a

 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any

 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the

 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial

 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple

 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and

 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with

 13  3 at least annually.

 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to

 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the

 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or

 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or

 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and

 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a

 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any

 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to

 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other

 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for

 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.

 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.
 15  8    The bill takes effect July 1, 2018.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a

 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any

 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to

 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other

 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.

 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated

 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other

 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.

 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the

 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a

 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.

 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new

 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated

 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under

 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to

 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new

 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of

 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated

 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to

 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third

 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to

 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative

 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or

 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.

 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a

 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is

 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated

 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation

 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated

 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other

 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under

 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple

 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and

 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply

 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records

 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation

 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 11 28                           EXPLANATION
 11 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 31    This bill establishes a motor vehicle insurance verification
 11 32 program to be administered by the department of transportation
 11 33 (DOT).  Following the applicable competitive bidding
 11 34 procedures, the DOT is required to contract with a third
 11 35 party for four years to act as the DOT's designated agent for
 12  1 administration of the program.
 12  2    The bill provides that a peace officer shall not stop or
 12  3 detain a person solely for a suspected violation of motor
 12  4 vehicle financial liability coverage requirements, and that
 12  5 such requirements are enforceable by a peace officer only as
 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.

 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of

 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the

 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to

 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial

 12  6 a secondary action when the driver of the vehicle has been
 12  7 stopped or detained for a suspected violation of another
 12  8 provision of  law. The bill prohibits the state or a political
 12  9 subdivision of the state from using any automated or remote
 12 10 system equipped with a camera or other optical device to
 12 11 identify persons operating a motor vehicle in violation of
 12 12 motor vehicle financial liability coverage requirements.
 12 13    The bill requires the DOT to establish an advisory council
 12 14 to make recommendations to the DOT on the best methods and
 12 15 practices for implementing a real=time internet services model
 12 16 for insurance verification, to assist in the development of
 12 17 a guide for insurers detailing the data fields and other
 12 18 information necessary for compliance with the bill, and to
 12 19 provide an annual report to the DOT detailing the improvements
 12 20 and implementation efforts relating to insurance verification
 12 21 in other states for consideration in improving compliance and
 12 22 operations in this state.
 12 23    The designated agent is required to establish and maintain a
 12 24 database containing information from insurers relating to motor
 12 25 vehicle insurance coverage for registered motor vehicles, motor
 12 26 vehicle identification information, personal identification
 12 27 information for registered owners of motor vehicles, and any
 12 28 other information provided to the designated agent by the DOT.
 12 29 At least twice per month, the designated agent must update the
 12 30 database and compare current motor vehicle registrations with
 12 31 updated insurance information.  If records in the database
 12 32 indicate that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 12 33 an owner's policy of liability insurance, the bill requires the
 12 34 designated agent to use a real=time internet services model
 12 35 to determine if the registered motor vehicle is covered under
 13  1 an owner's policy of liability insurance. The files in the
 13  2 database must be archived semiannually and audited by the DOT
 13  3 at least annually.
 13  4    If database records and the real=time internet services
 13  5 model show that a registered motor vehicle is not covered under
 13  6 an owner's policy of liability insurance for three consecutive
 13  7 months, the designated agent is required to send a notice to
 13  8 the owner requiring the owner to respond within 15 days by
 13  9 providing proof of financial liability coverage or proof that
 13 10 the owner is exempt from the requirement to maintain financial
 13 11 liability coverage.  If the owner fails to respond, a second
 13 12 notice must be sent.  If the owner does not respond to the
 13 13 second notice, the owner's motor vehicle registration must
 13 14 be revoked by the DOT and the owner is required to surrender
 13 15 the registration plates and registration receipt for the
 13 16 vehicle to the county treasurer.  In order to obtain a new
 13 17 registration for the vehicle, the owner must comply with
 13 18 financial responsibility requirements and pay an administrative
 13 19 fee of $100. The fees collected are to be used by the DOT
 13 20 exclusively to offset the costs of administering the program,
 13 21 including payments made to the designated agent.
 13 22    The bill provides that if a motor vehicle is covered by a
 13 23 form of financial liability coverage other than an insurance
 13 24 policy, or if a real=time internet services model indicates a
 13 25 vehicle is appropriately insured, that fact shall be noted in
 13 26 the database.
 13 27    The bill prohibits a person from providing false or
 13 28 fraudulent information to the DOT or the DOT's designated
 13 29 agent in relation to the motor vehicle insurance verification
 13 30 program.  A violation of this provision is a simple
 13 31 misdemeanor.
 13 32    The bill requires each insurer that issues a policy to the
 13 33 owner of a motor vehicle that includes motor vehicle liability
 13 34 coverage, uninsured motorist coverage, underinsured motorist
 13 35 coverage, or personal injury coverage to, before the 7th and
 14  1 the 21st of each month, provide the DOT's designated agent with
 14  2 a record of each motor vehicle insurance policy issued by the
 14  3 insurer and in effect for vehicles registered or garaged in
 14  4 the state as of the date of the previous submission. Vehicles
 14  5 subject to apportioned registration under Code chapter 326 are
 14  6 not included in this requirement.  Insurers that fail to comply
 14  7 with the reporting requirement may be assessed a civil penalty
 14  8 of $250 per day.  However, the DOT may waive the penalty upon a
 14  9 showing that the failure was inadvertent, accidental, or the
 14 10 result of excusable neglect. An insurer that discloses records
 14 11 to the DOT's designated agent in a reasonable, good=faith
 14 12 effort to comply with the bill is not subject to the penalty.
 14 13    Information contained in the database is confidential, but
 14 14 the bill provides exceptions for certain disclosures, including
 14 15 disclosures to state or local government agencies and courts
 14 16 for specified purposes, to individuals and certain other
 14 17 authorized persons, for purposes of an accident investigation,
 14 18 to law enforcement agencies and peace officers for certain
 14 19 official purposes, to the state auditor, and to financial
 14 20 institutions with a security interest in a motor vehicle.
 14 21 The designated agent may be authorized by the DOT to provide
 14 22 certified copies or electronic records, as appropriate, and to
 14 23 charge a fee for the provision of records and authentication
 14 24 of documents.
 14 25    A person, including the designated agent, who knowingly
 14 26 releases or discloses information from the database for a
 14 27 purpose other than those authorized in the bill or to a person
 14 28 who is not entitled to such information is guilty of a class
 14 29 "D" felony.
 14 30    The bill provides that the state and the DOT's designated
 14 31 agent are not liable to any person for gathering, managing, or
 14 32 using the information in the database in compliance with the
 14 33 bill. The bill further provides that the designated agent is
 14 34 responsible for maintaining and securing the information in the
 14 35 database provided by the DOT and insurers, and insurers acting
 15  1 in compliance with the bill are not liable to any person for
 15  2 the disclosure of information supplied to the DOT or designated
 15  3 agent. The bill requires the designated agent to indemnify
 15  4 an insurer against any loss arising from the disclosure of
 15  5 information supplied to the DOT or designated agent, provided
 15  6 the insurer supplied the information to the DOT or designated
 15  7 agent in a manner that complies with the bill.
