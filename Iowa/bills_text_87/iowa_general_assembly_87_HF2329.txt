  8 28                           EXPLANATION
  8 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 31    This bill relates to duties of and programs administered by
  8 32 the state board of regents and institutions governed by the
  8 33 board (regents institutions).
  8 34    The bill authorizes a regents institution which certifies
  8 35 to the Iowa telecommunications and technology commission
  9  1 that the institution is a part of or intends to become a
  9  2 part of the Iowa communications network to use the network
  9  3 for its video, data, or voice requirements as determined by
  9  4 the institution. Current law requires an institution that
  9  5 makes such a certification to use the network for all video,
  9  6 data, and voice requirements of the institution unless the
  9  7 institution petitions the commission for a waiver and meets one
  9  8 of certain specified criteria.
  9  9    The bill provides that public records for purposes of Code
  9 10 chapter 22, the state public records law, do not include
  9 11 records of an entity other than a government body in which a
  9 12 regents institution has invested.
  9 13    The bill provides that commercial or financial information
  9 14 that is proprietary and that is obtained by a regents
  9 15 institution from any source is a confidential record under
  9 16 Code chapter 22. The bill provides that certain specified
  9 17 records of or belonging to a regents institution, which have
  9 18 been developed, produced, discovered, learned, disclosed to,
  9 19 or collected or received by or on behalf of faculty, staff,
  9 20 employees, or students of the institution are confidential
  9 21 records under Code chapter 22.
  9 22    The bill modifies exemptions to Code chapter 23, which
  9 23 generally prohibits state agencies and political subdivisions
  9 24 from competing with private enterprise, applicable to
  9 25 regents institutions. The bill strikes language limiting
  9 26 such exemptions only to on=campus activities of regents
  9 27 institutions. The bill strikes language exempting services
  9 28 to patients and visitors at the university of Iowa hospitals
  9 29 and clinics and instead provides that health care and
  9 30 related services to patients and visitors by the university
  9 31 of Iowa hospitals and clinics are exempt from Code chapter
  9 32 23. The bill strikes language exempting goods, products,
  9 33 or professional services which are produced, created, or
  9 34 sold incidental to the institution's teaching, research, and
  9 35 extension mission and instead provides that goods, products,
 10  1 or professional services provided to the public by a regents
 10  2 institution in furtherance of the institution's mission are
 10  3 exempt from Code chapter 23.
 10  4    The bill provides that employees of regents institutions
 10  5 performing manufacturing, installation, and repair work do
 10  6 not need to hold licenses under Code chapter 103, relating to
 10  7 electricians and electrical contractors, while acting within
 10  8 the scope of their employment.
 10  9    The bill strikes language requiring the Iowa school for
 10 10 the deaf, the Iowa braille and sight saving school, and
 10 11 the university of Iowa hospitals and clinics' center for
 10 12 disabilities and development to provide transportation to
 10 13 students who would otherwise be without transportation.
 10 14 Language relating to transportation reimbursements for parents
 10 15 of students attending the school for the deaf and Iowa braille
 10 16 and sight saving school is retained.
 10 17    The bill strikes language providing for payment procedures
 10 18 involving counties and the department of administrative
 10 19 services for clothing, prescription refills, and other services
 10 20 provided by the Iowa school for the deaf, the Iowa braille and
 10 21 sight saving school, and the university of Iowa hospitals and
 10 22 clinics' center for disabilities and development.
 10 23    The bill strikes language providing for a phased=in
 10 24 implementation timeline for continuous improvement plans
 10 25 developed and implemented based upon the results of the regents
 10 26 institutions' student outcomes assessment programs. The
 10 27 phased=in implementation timeline has concluded. The bill
 10 28 strikes language requiring each regents institution to collect
 10 29 and use the results of formative and summative assessments in
 10 30 its continuous improvement plan for each undergraduate course.
 10 31 The bill requires the board of regents to annually evaluate
 10 32 the outcomes assessment programs in a report to the general
 10 33 assembly.
 10 34    The bill authorizes regents institutions to acquire, hold,
 10 35 and dispose of ownership or equity interests in entities that
 11  1 arise from research and development efforts conducted at that
 11  2 institution. The institution may use the institution's or the
 11  3 institution's affiliated entities' retained earnings for such
 11  4 acquisition.
 11  5    The bill authorizes a regents institution to invest funds
 11  6 belonging to the institution in private enterprises if such
 11  7 investment is done in furtherance of the institution's mission.
 11  8    The bill strikes language requiring the state board of
 11  9 regents to establish college=bound programs to provide Iowa
 11 10 minority students with information and experiences relating to
 11 11 opportunities offered at regents institutions.
