  2 30    This bill amends Code section 216C.11 to provide remedies

  2 34 of animals for the service dog or assistive animal of a person
  2 35 with a disability.  The Code also provides that the person is
  3  1 liable for damage done to any premises or facility by a service
  3  2 dog or assistive animal.

  3 14 be eliminated or reduced to an acceptable level by making

  3 16 practices, or procedures.
  3 17    Finally, the bill criminalizes the knowing misrepresentation
  3 18 of an animal as a service dog or assistive animal.  The bill
  3 19 would make this offense a simple misdemeanor.  A simple
  3 20 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement for no more than 30
  3 21 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or by
  3 22 both.  Under the bill, a person commits this offense if three
  3 23 criteria are met.  The first criterion is that the person
  3 24 intentionally misrepresents an animal in possession as a
  3 25 service dog or assistive animal for the purpose of obtaining
  3 26 any of the rights or privileges set forth in Code section
