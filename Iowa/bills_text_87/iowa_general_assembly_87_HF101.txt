 25 29                           EXPLANATION
 25 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 25 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 25 32    This bill amends Code chapter 68A, relating to campaign
 25 33 finance law, by creating a voluntary mechanism for publicly
 25 34 financed elections and establishing contribution limits for
 25 35 candidates who do not participate in the public financing
 26  1 process.
 26  2    The bill enacts a process for public financing for statewide
 26  3 and legislative elections and enacts new Code section 68A.801,
 26  4 providing definitions for key terms related to this process.
 26  5    New Code section 68A.823 establishes a separate,
 26  6 nonreverting fund in the state treasury to be known as the
 26  7 voter=owned Iowa clean elections (VOICE) fund, and new Code
 26  8 section 68A.824 provides sources of revenue for the fund.
 26  9    New Code sections 68A.802 and 68A.803 specify the
 26 10 eligibility procedures for both party and independent
 26 11 candidates to become participating candidates and specify
 26 12 the number of and details for collection of qualifying
 26 13 contributions.
 26 14    New Code section 68A.805 provides that any candidate who
 26 15 accepts benefits during the primary election campaign period
 26 16 must continue to comply with the requirements of the public
 26 17 financing process, even if the candidate stops accepting
 26 18 benefits of the program at any point during the primary or
 26 19 general election campaign periods.
 26 20    New Code section 68A.806 prohibits a participating candidate
 26 21 from accepting private funding during the primary and general
 26 22 election campaign periods other than certain permitted party
 26 23 funding.  Contributions in the name of another person are
 26 24 prohibited and subject to payment to the board as are any
 26 25 applicable penalties.  The use of personal funds for seed money
 26 26 or as qualifying contributions is limited by new Code section
 26 27 68A.809.
 26 28    New Code section 68A.807 establishes contribution limits for
 26 29 those candidates who choose not to participate in the public
 26 30 financing process.
 26 31    New Code section 68A.808 limits political party
 26 32 contributions and expenditures on behalf of participating
 26 33 candidates.
 26 34    New Code section 68A.810 details the collection of private
 26 35 contributions for use as seed money, limited by new Code
 27  1 section 68A.809 to a $100 contribution per individual person
 27  2 at least 18 years of age, and also limited in the aggregate in
 27  3 differing amounts for candidates for governor and lieutenant
 27  4 governor, for other statewide candidates, for Iowa senate
 27  5 candidates, and for Iowa house of representatives candidates.
 27  6 Seed money expenditures are limited to the clean election
 27  7 campaign qualifying period and seed money contributions and
 27  8 expenditures must be fully disclosed at the end of the public
 27  9 financing qualifying period.
 27 10    New Code section 68A.812 provides for a certification
 27 11 process after a candidate applies for public financing campaign
 27 12 funding benefits and requires repayment of funds if eligibility
 27 13 is revoked.  The bill provides for audit and judicial review of
 27 14 certification decisions made by the board.
 27 15    New Code section 68A.813 provides certain benefits and
 27 16 obligations for participating candidates, including specified
 27 17 amounts of public funding pursuant to new Code section
 27 18 68A.815, mandatory participation in debates pursuant to new
 27 19 Code sections 68A.811 and 68A.822, and, pursuant to new Code
 27 20 section 68A.817, additional limited public funding to respond
 27 21 to certain excess expenditures by nonparticipating candidates,
 27 22 independent expenditures, and electioneering communications
 27 23 expenditures.
 27 24    New Code section 68A.814 provides for a schedule of payments
 27 25 to participating candidates, and new Code section 68A.815
 27 26 specifies differing total amounts for primary and general
 27 27 elections for candidates for governor and lieutenant governor,
 27 28 for other statewide candidates, for Iowa senate candidates,
 27 29 and for Iowa house of representatives candidates.  Alternate
 27 30 amounts are provided for uncontested races.  Pursuant to new
 27 31 Code section 68A.816, clean election campaign funding payments
 27 32 must be used only for campaign=related expenses, and cannot be
 27 33 used for payments in violation of law or to repay personal or
 27 34 business loans, expenditures, or debts.
 27 35    New Code section 68A.817 provides that nonparticipating
 28  1 candidates must disclose within 48 hours every expenditure
 28  2 in excess of the public financing funding allocated to the
 28  3 candidate's participating opponent that in the aggregate is
 28  4 more than $1,000.  Certain other reporting requirements apply
 28  5 during the last 20 days of a campaign.
 28  6    All candidates must include a statement with all
 28  7 advertisements indicating that the candidate has approved of
 28  8 the contents of the advertisement, pursuant to new Code section
 28  9 68A.818.
 28 10    New Code section 68A.819 provides that persons making
 28 11 certain independent expenditures must report such expenditures
 28 12 to the board, along with an affidavit affirming that the
 28 13 expenditure has not been coordinated with the candidate or
 28 14 party.  Alleged violations of the coordination affirmation are
 28 15 subject to an expedited hearing procedure.
 28 16    Persons making certain electioneering communications must
 28 17 also report to the board, pursuant to new Code section 68A.820.
 28 18    New Code section 68A.821 provides that the board shall
 28 19 administer a voter information program, including establishment
 28 20 of an advisory council, to provide voters with election=related
 28 21 information, including a voter guide with candidate
 28 22 biographical material, policy statements, voting records, and
 28 23 whether the candidate funds the campaign with public or private
 28 24 money.
 28 25    New Code section 68A.825 provides the board with certain
 28 26 specific enforcement powers and duties in relation to the
 28 27 new subchapter, and new Code section 68A.827 provides for an
 28 28 election cycle report by the board to the general assembly on
 28 29 the public financing process.
 28 30    New Code section 68A.826 creates a civil right of action for
 28 31 citizens alleging that a candidate has violated the law.
 28 32    Violations of the public financing process are subject
 28 33 to aggravated misdemeanor penalties, pursuant to new Code
 28 34 section 68A.829.  An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable
 28 35 by confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at
 29  1 least $625 but not more than $6,250.  New Code section 68A.828
 29  2 provides for repayment of certain excess expenditures by the
 29  3 candidate.
 29  4    New Code sections 68A.610 and 422.12I create an income tax
 29  5 checkoff for the voter=owned Iowa clean elections fund.  This
 29  6 checkoff allows a person to direct that $5 of that person's
 29  7 state income tax liability be paid over to the Iowa voter=owned
 29  8 clean elections fund.
 29  9    Code section 422.7, new subsection 59, is enacted to
 29 10 provide up to a $200 exemption from income for purposes of the
 29 11 individual income tax for contributions to the Iowa voter=owned
 29 12 clean elections fund.
 29 13    Code section 556.18 is amended to provide that $10 million
 29 14 shall be annually transferred from the proceeds from the sale
 29 15 by the state of lost or unclaimed property to the voter=owned
 29 16 Iowa clean elections fund.
 29 17    The sections of the bill enacting the income tax checkoff,
 29 18 the exemption from the individual income tax, and the transfer
 29 19 in Code section 556.18 take effect January 1, 2018.  The
 29 20 remainder of the bill takes effect November 4, 2020, which
 29 21 is the day after the 2020 general election day, to allow the
 29 22 public financing process to commence with a new campaign cycle.
 29 23 New Code section 68A.804 provides guidelines for disposition of
 29 24 money collected by candidates prior to the effective date of
 29 25 the public financing process.
 29 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 29 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 29 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 29 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 29 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 29 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 29 32 mandate included in the bill.

 29  4    New Code sections 68A.610 and 422.12I create an income tax

 29  6 checkoff allows a person to direct that $5 of that person's

 29  8 clean elections fund.
 29  9    Code section 422.7, new subsection 59, is enacted to

 29 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 29 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 29 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 29 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 29 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 29 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 29 32 mandate included in the bill.
