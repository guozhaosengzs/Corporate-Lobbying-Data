  1  1    Section 1.  The following amendment to the Constitution of
  1  2 the State of Iowa is proposed:
  1  3    The Constitution of the State of Iowa is amended by adding
  1  4 the following new section to a new Article:
  1  5    ARTICLE _____.
  1  6    EXPENDITURE LIMITATION.
  1  7 General fund expenditure limitation.SECTION 1.
  1  8    1.  For the purposes of this section:
  1  9    a.  "Adjusted revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 10 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 11 revenue estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 12 session of the general assembly, for the general fund for the
  1 13 following fiscal year, as determined by the revenue estimating
  1 14 conference, adjusted by subtracting estimated refunds payable
  1 15 from that estimated revenue.  However, if the state general
  1 16 fund expenditure limitation is calculated based upon the
  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary
  1 19 session prior to the commencement of the fiscal year to which
  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure
  1 26 limitation applies.
  1 27    c.  "General fund" means the principal operating fund of the

  1 29    d.  "Net revenue estimate" means the most recent revenue
  1 30 estimate determined before January 1, or a later and lower
  1 31 estimate determined before adjournment of the regular
  1 32 session of the general assembly, for the general fund
  1 33 for the current fiscal year, as determined by the revenue
  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund
  2 13 due to state taxes or fees in effect as of January 1 following
  2 14 the most recent meeting of the revenue estimating conference.
  2 15 "New revenue" also includes moneys received by the general
  2 16 fund due to new transfers to the general fund over and above
  2 17 those moneys received by the general fund due to transfers in
  2 18 effect as of January 1 following the most recent meeting of the
  2 19 revenue estimating conference.
  2 20    2.  A state general fund expenditure limitation is created,
  2 21 as calculated in subsection 3, for each fiscal year beginning
  2 22 on or after July 1 following ratification by the voters of this
  2 23 amendment to the Constitution of the State of Iowa.
  2 24    3.  The state general fund expenditure limitation for a
  2 25 fiscal year shall be the lesser of the following amounts:
  2 26    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 27 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 28    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 29 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 30    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 31 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  2 32 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  2 33    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  2 34 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  2 35 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  1 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in
  3  2 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate,
  3  3 as applicable, shall be ninety=five percent of the amount
  3  4 remaining after subtracting estimated refunds payable from the
  3  5 projected revenue from that source.
  3  6    6.  If a revenue decrease is proposed, the projection for the
  3  7 revenue source used for that revenue decrease for the period
  3  8 beginning on the effective date of the revenue decrease and
  3  9 ending in the fiscal year in which that decrease is included in
  3 10 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate, as
  3 11 applicable, shall be one hundred percent of the amount of the
  3 12 projected revenue decrease from that source.
  3 13    7.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 14 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 15 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 16 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.
  3 17    8.  The governor shall submit and the general assembly shall
  3 18 pass a budget which does not exceed the state general fund
  3 19 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 20 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 21 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause the
  3 22 final appropriations approved by the governor to exceed the
  3 23 state general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 24    9.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 25 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes
  3 26 reversion of any part of the total of the appropriations
  3 27 included in the budget.
  3 28    10.  The general assembly shall establish by law a general
  3 29 fund of the state and a revenue estimating conference. The
  3 30 general assembly shall enact laws to implement this section.
  3 31    11.  The general assembly may suspend the application of this
  3 32 article by passage of a joint resolution, subject to approval
  3 33 by the governor, by two=thirds of the members elected to each
  3 34 house of the general assembly.
  3 35    Sec. 2.  REFERRAL AND PUBLICATION.  The foregoing amendment

  4  2 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  3 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of
  4  4 state is directed to cause the same to be published for three
  4  5 consecutive months previous to the date of that election as
  4  6 provided by law.

  2 26    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 27 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 28    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 29 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 30    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 31 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  2 32 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  2 33    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  2 34 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  2 35 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and

  3 11 applicable, shall be one hundred percent of the amount of the

  2 27 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 28    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 29 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 30    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 31 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  2 32 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  2 33    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  2 34 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  2 35 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and

  3 11 applicable, shall be one hundred percent of the amount of the

  1 17 adjusted revenue estimate and not based upon the net revenue
  1 18 estimate and the general assembly holds an extraordinary

  1 20 the adjusted revenue estimate applies and if before or during
  1 21 the extraordinary session the revenue estimating conference
  1 22 determines a lower revenue estimate, the lower estimate shall
  1 23 be used for calculating the adjusted revenue estimate.
  1 24    b.  "Current fiscal year" means the fiscal year preceding
  1 25 the fiscal year to which the state general fund expenditure

  1 34 estimating conference, and adjusted by subtracting estimated
  1 35 refunds payable from that estimated revenue.  However, if
  2  1 the state general fund expenditure limitation is calculated
  2  2 based upon the net revenue estimate and not based upon the
  2  3 adjusted revenue estimate and the general assembly holds an
  2  4 extraordinary session prior to the completion of the fiscal
  2  5 year to which the net revenue estimate applies and if before
  2  6 or during the extraordinary session the revenue estimating
  2  7 conference determines a lower revenue estimate for the current
  2  8 fiscal year, the lower estimate shall be used for calculating
  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or
  2 12 fees over and above those moneys received by the general fund

  2 26    a.  Ninety=nine percent of the adjusted revenue estimate for
  2 27 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 28    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 29 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 30    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 31 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  2 32 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  2 33    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  2 34 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  2 35 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and
  3  1 ending in the fiscal year in which that source is included in

  3 10 the adjusted revenue estimate or the net revenue estimate, as
  3 11 applicable, shall be one hundred percent of the amount of the
  3 12 projected revenue decrease from that source.
  3 13    7.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 14 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
  3 15 include federal funds, donations, constitutionally dedicated
  3 16 moneys, and moneys expended from a state retirement system.

  3 19 expenditure limitation. The governor shall not approve or
  3 20 disapprove appropriation bills or items of appropriation bills
  3 21 passed by the general assembly in a manner that would cause the
  3 22 final appropriations approved by the governor to exceed the
  3 23 state general fund expenditure limitation.
  3 24    9.  The governor shall not submit and the general assembly
  3 25 shall not pass a budget which in order to balance assumes

  2  9 the net revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 10    e.  "New revenue" means moneys received by the general fund
  2 11 due to increased tax rates or fees or newly created taxes or

  2 27 the following fiscal year for the general fund.
  2 28    b.  One hundred four percent of the current fiscal year net
  2 29 revenue estimate for the general fund.
  2 30    4.  The state general fund expenditure limitation shall be
  2 31 used by the governor in the preparation and approval of the
  2 32 budget and by the general assembly in the budget process.
  2 33    5.  If a new revenue source is proposed, the budget revenue
  2 34 projection used for that new revenue source for the period
  2 35 beginning on the effective date of the new revenue source and

  3 11 applicable, shall be one hundred percent of the amount of the
  3 12 projected revenue decrease from that source.
  3 13    7.  The scope of the state general fund expenditure
  3 14 limitation calculated in accordance with this section shall not
