CONTINGENT
IMPLEMENTATION.
The
secretary
is
required
to
17


fully
implement
the
bill
upon
meeting
two
conditions:
(1)
18


adequate
moneys
being
appropriated
to
the
secretary
and
(2)
19


certification
of
the
system
by
the
United

department
20


of
agriculture.
The
date
of
full
implementation
occurs
on
a
21


date
selected
by
the
secretary
but
cannot
commence
until
the
22


date
of
implementation
is
published
three
times
in
the
Iowa
23


administrative
bulletin.
24


BACKGROUND
——
GENERAL.
The
provisions
of
the
bill
are
25


closely
connected
with
provisions
in
Code
chapter
554,
article
26


9,
Iowa’s
version
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
governing
27


secured
transactions.
A
secured
party
ordinarily
perfects
a
28


security
interest
in
collateral
(personal
property)
including
29


farm
products
by
filing
a
financing
statement
(UCC-1)
with
the
30


secretary
of
state
and
thereby
creating
a
priority
status
when
31


compared
to
other
secured
parties
(article
9,
part
3).
Article
32


9
provides
an
exception
for
buyers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
33


business
who
generally
take
free
of
a
security
interest
created
34


by
the
seller
even
in
cases
in
which
the
security
interest
has

been
perfected
and
the
buyer
is
aware
of
its
existence
(Code
1


section
554.9320).
However,
notwithstanding
this
exception,
2


a
buyer
who
purchases
a
farm
product
from
a
person
engaged
in
3


farming
operations
may
not
take
free
of
a
security
interest.
4


The
Federal
Food
Security
Act
(1985)
preempts
state’s
article
5


9
requirements
by
providing
that
a
buyer
in
the
ordinary
6


course
of
business,
a
commission
merchant,
or
a
selling
agent
7


(all
classified
under
the
term
“buyer”)
may
buy
farm
products
8


without
being
subject
to
a
security
interest
created
by
the
9


seller.
However,
the
federal
law
allows
a
secured
party
10


to
take
action
to
prevent
a
buyer
from
taking
clear
of
the
11


security
interest
by
following
certain
steps
designed
to
notify
12


buyers.
13


BACKGROUND
——
NOTIFICATION
SYSTEMS.
The
federal
law
allows
14


states
to
elect
between
two
notification
options:
(1)
Iowa’s
15


current
system
requiring
the
secured
party
to
deliver
direct
16


notice
to
potential
buyers
of
a
secured
party’s
interest
in
the
17


farm
products
within
one
year
prior
to
sale
or
(2)
the
system
18


contemplated
in
the
bill
which
would
establish
the
central
19


notification
system.
In
