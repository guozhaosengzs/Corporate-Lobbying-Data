  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This bill relates to the transferability of tax credits
  2 13 issued to housing businesses under the enterprise zone program,
  2 14 which the general assembly repealed in 2014.  Investment tax
  2 15 credits issued under that prior program were transferable for
  2 16 housing developments located on brownfield sites or in blighted
  2 17 areas, but the economic development authority (authority)
  2 18 could only approve a maximum of $3 million worth of credits
  2 19 for transfer each calendar year, and no more than $1.5 million
  2 20 could be transferred to any one housing development during
  2 21 each calendar year.  Prior law provided an exception to
  2 22 these transfer restrictions for certain housing developments,
  2 23 allowing any amount of the tax credits to be transferred during
  2 24 a calendar year.
  2 25    The bill provides another exception to the tax credit
  2 26 transfer restrictions described above.  The bill provides that
  2 27 the full amount of tax credits awarded to an eligible housing
  2 28 business before July 1, 2015, may be transferred during a
  2 29 calendar year provided the housing development is located in a
  2 30 blighted area and in a county with a total population of less
