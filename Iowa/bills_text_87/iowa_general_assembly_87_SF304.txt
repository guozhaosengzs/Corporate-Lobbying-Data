  3 34                           EXPLANATION
  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity
  4  3 budget adjustment and modifies limitations on the amount
  4  4 of allowable school district cash reserves.  The board of
  4  5 directors of a school district with a regular program district
  4  6 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
  4  7 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4  8 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
  4  9 requesting to receive the budget adjustment authorized in
  4 10 the bill. Following adoption of the resolution the board of
  4 11 directors must, within 10 days of its adoption, notify the
  4 12 department of management of the amount of the budget adjustment
  4 13 requested. The department of management shall approve the
  4 14 budget adjustment for an amount not to exceed the maximum
  4 15 budget adjustment amount authorized in the bill.
  4 16    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  4 17 approved school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  4 18 for that budget year in an amount not to exceed the lesser of
  4 19 the difference between the school district's regular program
  4 20 district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  4 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4 22 state multiplied by the district's budget enrollment and
  4 23 the difference between the school district's cash reserve
  4 24 limitation under Code section 298.10, subsection 3, and 15
  4 25 percent of the school district's general fund expenditures
  4 26 for the year previous to the base year minus the unexpended
  4 27 fund balance for the year previous to the base year.  The
  4 28 budget adjustment amount may be less than the maximum amount
  4 29 authorized under the bill. The bill requires the school
  4 30 district to fund the budget adjustment using cash reserve
  4 31 funds, interest earned on cash reserve funds, or both. If,
  4 32 however, the school district funds the budget adjustment solely
  4 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds during the base
  4 34 year, the amount of the budget adjustment shall not reduce the
  4 35 school district's cash reserve limitation provided for in the
  5  1 bill.
  5  2    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  3 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5  4 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5  5 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  5  6 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  5  7 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  5  8 future budget year.
  5  9    Under the bill, if a school district uses funds from its cash
  5 10 reserve, including interest earned on such funds, during the
  5 11 base year to fund a budget adjustment authorized in the bill,
  5 12 the board of directors of the school district shall include in
  5 13 its general fund budget document information about the amount
  5 14 of the cash reserve used for such purpose.
  5 15     The bill provides that interest earned on cash reserve
  5 16 funds during a budget year may be added to the district's
  5 17 existing cash reserve amount within the general fund or may
  5 18 be designated by the school board to be used to fund a budget
  5 19 adjustment authorized in the bill. However, the interest
  5 20 amounts so designated shall not be included in district cost.
  5 21    Currently, Code section 298.10 directs the department of
  5 22 management to limit the school district's cash reserve levy to
  5 23 a level that is not in excess of 20 percent of the general fund
  5 24 expenditures for the year previous to the base year minus the
  5 25 unexpended fund balance for the year previous to the base year.
  5 26 The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
  5 27 July 1, 2018, the cash reserve levy for a school district that
  5 28 received a budget adjustment under the bill shall not exceed
  5 29 the amount determined under the current law limitation minus
  5 30 the sum of all budget adjustments received by the district
  5 31 under the bill for all previous budget years, excluding those
  5 32 budget years for which the budget adjustment was funded solely
  5 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds.
  5 34    Notwithstanding the May 15 deadline for adopting a
  5 35 resolution to approve the budget adjustment provided for in the
  6  1 bill, for the school budget year beginning July 1, 2017, the
  6  2 resolution of the board of directors of a school district must
  6  3 be approved not later than June 10, 2017.

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity
  4  3 budget adjustment and modifies limitations on the amount
  4  4 of allowable school district cash reserves.  The board of
  4  5 directors of a school district with a regular program district
  4  6 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
  4  7 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4  8 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
  4  9 requesting to receive the budget adjustment authorized in
  4 10 the bill. Following adoption of the resolution the board of
  4 11 directors must, within 10 days of its adoption, notify the
  4 12 department of management of the amount of the budget adjustment
  4 13 requested. The department of management shall approve the
  4 14 budget adjustment for an amount not to exceed the maximum
  4 15 budget adjustment amount authorized in the bill.
  4 16    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  4 17 approved school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  4 18 for that budget year in an amount not to exceed the lesser of
  4 19 the difference between the school district's regular program
  4 20 district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  4 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4 22 state multiplied by the district's budget enrollment and
  4 23 the difference between the school district's cash reserve
  4 24 limitation under Code section 298.10, subsection 3, and 15
  4 25 percent of the school district's general fund expenditures
  4 26 for the year previous to the base year minus the unexpended
  4 27 fund balance for the year previous to the base year.  The
  4 28 budget adjustment amount may be less than the maximum amount
  4 29 authorized under the bill. The bill requires the school
  4 30 district to fund the budget adjustment using cash reserve
  4 31 funds, interest earned on cash reserve funds, or both. If,
  4 32 however, the school district funds the budget adjustment solely
  4 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds during the base
  4 34 year, the amount of the budget adjustment shall not reduce the
  4 35 school district's cash reserve limitation provided for in the
  5  1 bill.
  5  2    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  3 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5  4 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5  5 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  5  6 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  5  7 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  5  8 future budget year.
  5  9    Under the bill, if a school district uses funds from its cash
  5 10 reserve, including interest earned on such funds, during the
  5 11 base year to fund a budget adjustment authorized in the bill,
  5 12 the board of directors of the school district shall include in
  5 13 its general fund budget document information about the amount
  5 14 of the cash reserve used for such purpose.
  5 15     The bill provides that interest earned on cash reserve
  5 16 funds during a budget year may be added to the district's
  5 17 existing cash reserve amount within the general fund or may
  5 18 be designated by the school board to be used to fund a budget
  5 19 adjustment authorized in the bill. However, the interest
  5 20 amounts so designated shall not be included in district cost.
  5 21    Currently, Code section 298.10 directs the department of
  5 22 management to limit the school district's cash reserve levy to
  5 23 a level that is not in excess of 20 percent of the general fund
  5 24 expenditures for the year previous to the base year minus the
  5 25 unexpended fund balance for the year previous to the base year.
  5 26 The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
  5 27 July 1, 2018, the cash reserve levy for a school district that
  5 28 received a budget adjustment under the bill shall not exceed
  5 29 the amount determined under the current law limitation minus
  5 30 the sum of all budget adjustments received by the district
  5 31 under the bill for all previous budget years, excluding those
  5 32 budget years for which the budget adjustment was funded solely
  5 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds.
  5 34    Notwithstanding the May 15 deadline for adopting a

  4 35 school district's cash reserve limitation provided for in the
  5  1 bill.
  5  2    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  3 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5  4 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5  5 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  5  6 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  5  7 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  5  8 future budget year.
  5  9    Under the bill, if a school district uses funds from its cash
  5 10 reserve, including interest earned on such funds, during the
  5 11 base year to fund a budget adjustment authorized in the bill,
  5 12 the board of directors of the school district shall include in
  5 13 its general fund budget document information about the amount
  5 14 of the cash reserve used for such purpose.
  5 15     The bill provides that interest earned on cash reserve
  5 16 funds during a budget year may be added to the district's
  5 17 existing cash reserve amount within the general fund or may
  5 18 be designated by the school board to be used to fund a budget
  5 19 adjustment authorized in the bill. However, the interest
  5 20 amounts so designated shall not be included in district cost.
  5 21    Currently, Code section 298.10 directs the department of
  5 22 management to limit the school district's cash reserve levy to
  5 23 a level that is not in excess of 20 percent of the general fund
  5 24 expenditures for the year previous to the base year minus the
  5 25 unexpended fund balance for the year previous to the base year.
  5 26 The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
  5 27 July 1, 2018, the cash reserve levy for a school district that
  5 28 received a budget adjustment under the bill shall not exceed
  5 29 the amount determined under the current law limitation minus
  5 30 the sum of all budget adjustments received by the district
  5 31 under the bill for all previous budget years, excluding those
  5 32 budget years for which the budget adjustment was funded solely
  5 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds.

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity
  4  3 budget adjustment and modifies limitations on the amount
  4  4 of allowable school district cash reserves.  The board of
  4  5 directors of a school district with a regular program district
  4  6 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
  4  7 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4  8 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
  4  9 requesting to receive the budget adjustment authorized in
  4 10 the bill. Following adoption of the resolution the board of
  4 11 directors must, within 10 days of its adoption, notify the
  4 12 department of management of the amount of the budget adjustment
  4 13 requested. The department of management shall approve the
  4 14 budget adjustment for an amount not to exceed the maximum
  4 15 budget adjustment amount authorized in the bill.
  4 16    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  4 17 approved school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  4 18 for that budget year in an amount not to exceed the lesser of
  4 19 the difference between the school district's regular program
  4 20 district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  4 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4 22 state multiplied by the district's budget enrollment and
  4 23 the difference between the school district's cash reserve
  4 24 limitation under Code section 298.10, subsection 3, and 15
  4 25 percent of the school district's general fund expenditures
  4 26 for the year previous to the base year minus the unexpended
  4 27 fund balance for the year previous to the base year.  The
  4 28 budget adjustment amount may be less than the maximum amount
  4 29 authorized under the bill. The bill requires the school
  4 30 district to fund the budget adjustment using cash reserve
  4 31 funds, interest earned on cash reserve funds, or both. If,
  4 32 however, the school district funds the budget adjustment solely
  4 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds during the base
  4 34 year, the amount of the budget adjustment shall not reduce the
  4 35 school district's cash reserve limitation provided for in the
  5  1 bill.
  5  2    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  3 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5  4 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5  5 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  5  6 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  5  7 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  5  8 future budget year.
  5  9    Under the bill, if a school district uses funds from its cash
  5 10 reserve, including interest earned on such funds, during the
  5 11 base year to fund a budget adjustment authorized in the bill,
  5 12 the board of directors of the school district shall include in
  5 13 its general fund budget document information about the amount
  5 14 of the cash reserve used for such purpose.
  5 15     The bill provides that interest earned on cash reserve
  5 16 funds during a budget year may be added to the district's
  5 17 existing cash reserve amount within the general fund or may
  5 18 be designated by the school board to be used to fund a budget
  5 19 adjustment authorized in the bill. However, the interest
  5 20 amounts so designated shall not be included in district cost.
  5 21    Currently, Code section 298.10 directs the department of
  5 22 management to limit the school district's cash reserve levy to
  5 23 a level that is not in excess of 20 percent of the general fund
  5 24 expenditures for the year previous to the base year minus the
  5 25 unexpended fund balance for the year previous to the base year.
  5 26 The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
  5 27 July 1, 2018, the cash reserve levy for a school district that
  5 28 received a budget adjustment under the bill shall not exceed
  5 29 the amount determined under the current law limitation minus
  5 30 the sum of all budget adjustments received by the district
  5 31 under the bill for all previous budget years, excluding those
  5 32 budget years for which the budget adjustment was funded solely
  5 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds.

  4 18 for that budget year in an amount not to exceed the lesser of
  4 19 the difference between the school district's regular program
  4 20 district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  4 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the

  4 30 district to fund the budget adjustment using cash reserve
  4 31 funds, interest earned on cash reserve funds, or both. If,

  5 11 base year to fund a budget adjustment authorized in the bill,
  5 12 the board of directors of the school district shall include in
  5 13 its general fund budget document information about the amount
  5 14 of the cash reserve used for such purpose.
  5 15     The bill provides that interest earned on cash reserve
  5 16 funds during a budget year may be added to the district's
  5 17 existing cash reserve amount within the general fund or may
  5 18 be designated by the school board to be used to fund a budget

  3 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  2    This bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity
  4  3 budget adjustment and modifies limitations on the amount
  4  4 of allowable school district cash reserves.  The board of
  4  5 directors of a school district with a regular program district
  4  6 cost per pupil that is less than the highest regular program
  4  7 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4  8 state for the same budget year may annually adopt a resolution
  4  9 requesting to receive the budget adjustment authorized in
  4 10 the bill. Following adoption of the resolution the board of
  4 11 directors must, within 10 days of its adoption, notify the
  4 12 department of management of the amount of the budget adjustment
  4 13 requested. The department of management shall approve the
  4 14 budget adjustment for an amount not to exceed the maximum
  4 15 budget adjustment amount authorized in the bill.
  4 16    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  4 17 approved school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  4 18 for that budget year in an amount not to exceed the lesser of
  4 19 the difference between the school district's regular program
  4 20 district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  4 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4 22 state multiplied by the district's budget enrollment and
  4 23 the difference between the school district's cash reserve
  4 24 limitation under Code section 298.10, subsection 3, and 15
  4 25 percent of the school district's general fund expenditures
  4 26 for the year previous to the base year minus the unexpended
  4 27 fund balance for the year previous to the base year.  The
  4 28 budget adjustment amount may be less than the maximum amount
  4 29 authorized under the bill. The bill requires the school
  4 30 district to fund the budget adjustment using cash reserve
  4 31 funds, interest earned on cash reserve funds, or both. If,
  4 32 however, the school district funds the budget adjustment solely
  4 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds during the base
  4 34 year, the amount of the budget adjustment shall not reduce the
  4 35 school district's cash reserve limitation provided for in the
  5  1 bill.
  5  2    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  3 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5  4 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5  5 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  5  6 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  5  7 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  5  8 future budget year.
  5  9    Under the bill, if a school district uses funds from its cash
  5 10 reserve, including interest earned on such funds, during the
  5 11 base year to fund a budget adjustment authorized in the bill,
  5 12 the board of directors of the school district shall include in
  5 13 its general fund budget document information about the amount
  5 14 of the cash reserve used for such purpose.
  5 15     The bill provides that interest earned on cash reserve
  5 16 funds during a budget year may be added to the district's
  5 17 existing cash reserve amount within the general fund or may
  5 18 be designated by the school board to be used to fund a budget
  5 19 adjustment authorized in the bill. However, the interest
  5 20 amounts so designated shall not be included in district cost.
  5 21    Currently, Code section 298.10 directs the department of
  5 22 management to limit the school district's cash reserve levy to
  5 23 a level that is not in excess of 20 percent of the general fund
  5 24 expenditures for the year previous to the base year minus the
  5 25 unexpended fund balance for the year previous to the base year.
  5 26 The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after

  5 28 received a budget adjustment under the bill shall not exceed

  4 16    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each
  4 17 approved school district is eligible for a budget adjustment
  4 18 for that budget year in an amount not to exceed the lesser of
  4 19 the difference between the school district's regular program
  4 20 district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  4 21 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  4 22 state multiplied by the district's budget enrollment and
  4 23 the difference between the school district's cash reserve
  4 24 limitation under Code section 298.10, subsection 3, and 15
  4 25 percent of the school district's general fund expenditures
  4 26 for the year previous to the base year minus the unexpended
  4 27 fund balance for the year previous to the base year.  The
  4 28 budget adjustment amount may be less than the maximum amount
  4 29 authorized under the bill. The bill requires the school
  4 30 district to fund the budget adjustment using cash reserve
  4 31 funds, interest earned on cash reserve funds, or both. If,
  4 32 however, the school district funds the budget adjustment solely
  4 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds during the base
  4 34 year, the amount of the budget adjustment shall not reduce the
  4 35 school district's cash reserve limitation provided for in the
  5  1 bill.
  5  2    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  3 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5  4 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5  5 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  5  6 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  5  7 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  5  8 future budget year.
  5  9    Under the bill, if a school district uses funds from its cash
  5 10 reserve, including interest earned on such funds, during the
  5 11 base year to fund a budget adjustment authorized in the bill,
  5 12 the board of directors of the school district shall include in
  5 13 its general fund budget document information about the amount
  5 14 of the cash reserve used for such purpose.
  5 15     The bill provides that interest earned on cash reserve
  5 16 funds during a budget year may be added to the district's
  5 17 existing cash reserve amount within the general fund or may
  5 18 be designated by the school board to be used to fund a budget
  5 19 adjustment authorized in the bill. However, the interest
  5 20 amounts so designated shall not be included in district cost.
  5 21    Currently, Code section 298.10 directs the department of
  5 22 management to limit the school district's cash reserve levy to
  5 23 a level that is not in excess of 20 percent of the general fund
  5 24 expenditures for the year previous to the base year minus the
  5 25 unexpended fund balance for the year previous to the base year.
  5 26 The bill provides that for fiscal years beginning on or after
  5 27 July 1, 2018, the cash reserve levy for a school district that
  5 28 received a budget adjustment under the bill shall not exceed
  5 29 the amount determined under the current law limitation minus
  5 30 the sum of all budget adjustments received by the district
  5 31 under the bill for all previous budget years, excluding those

  5 33 with interest earned on cash reserve funds.

  5  3 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5  4 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5  5 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  5  6 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  5  7 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
