  2  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 10    In 2016, the general assembly passed legislation requiring,
  2 11 on or before September 15 of each year, the county engineer of
  2 12 each county to certify and file a report with the department
  2 13 of transportation (DOT), as part of the annual report required
  2 14 under Code section 309.22, detailing the manner in which moneys
  2 15 received by the county from the road use tax fund were used to
  2 16 replace or repair structurally deficient bridges in the county.
  2 17 The legislation also required, on or before February 15 of each
  2 18 year, the DOT, in collaboration with the Iowa county engineers
  2 19 association, to compile the annual reports into a cumulative
  2 20 report and submit the cumulative report in electronic format
  2 21 to the chairpersons of the senate and house of representatives
  2 22 standing committees on transportation and the legislative
  2 23 services agency. These provisions are set to be repealed
  2 24 effective June 30, 2019.
  2 25    This bill strikes the future repeal provisions. Because
  2 26 counties generally do not receive moneys directly from the
  2 27 road use tax fund, the bill also clarifies that the reporting
  2 28 requirements apply to moneys that originated from the road use
  2 29 tax fund.
