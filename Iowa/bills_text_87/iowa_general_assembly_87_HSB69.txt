17


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
18


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
19


Under
current
law,
commercial
learner’s
permits
are
valid
20


for
180
days
and
may
be
renewed
for
an
additional
180
days
21


without
retaking
the
required
general
and
endorsement
knowledge
22


tests.
This
bill
alters
that
provision
to
incorporate
by
23


reference
the
validity
and
renewal
periods
provided
by
the
24


code
of
federal
regulations
as
well
as

exemption

Although

agencies
are
currently
28


exempted
from
those
periods
by
the
federal

carrier
safety
29


administration,
and
may
instead
allow
commercial
learner’s
30


permits
to
be
valid
for
one
year
with
no
renewal
period.
31


Current
law
provides
that
certain
employees
of
the
32


department
of
transportation
(DOT)
may
be
designated
as
peace
33


officers
authorized
to
control
and
direct
traffic
and
weigh
34


vehicles,
and
to
make
arrests
for
violations
of
