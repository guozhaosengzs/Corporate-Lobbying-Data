  7  9                           EXPLANATION
  7 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 12    This bill creates an economic development program that
  7 13 allows a certified supplier to make an adjustment to net income
  7 14 for state individual and corporate income tax purposes. The
  7 15 adjustment is available for corporations and shareholders of
  7 16 subchapter S corporations.
  7 17    To qualify as a certified supplier under the bill, a business
  7 18 must meet several requirements.  The business must manufacture
  7 19 tangible personal property in Iowa but cannot be an anchor
  7 20 manufacturer.  The business must derive more than 10 percent
  7 21 of its gross sales from sales to anchor manufacturers, and all
  7 22 such sales must be arm's length transactions.  The business
  7 23 must supply the authority with signed statements from a certain
  7 24 number of anchor manufacturers attesting to certain information
  7 25 as prescribed in the bill and must agree to annually provide
  7 26 to the authority information and data on jobs and capital
  7 27 investments made in the state by the business.  Finally, the
  7 28 business must maintain at least 10 percent of its payroll in
  7 29 Iowa or employ at least 50 employees in Iowa.
  7 30    "Anchor manufacturer" is defined as a business that
  7 31 manufactures tangible personal property in Iowa and exports at
  7 32 least 50 percent of the tangible personal property manufactured
  7 33 in Iowa outside of the state.
  7 34    A business that meets all of the qualifications of a
  7 35 certified supplier may annually apply to the authority to
  8  1 receive a certificate labeling the business as a certified
  8  2 supplier.  A business must apply for a certificate no later
  8  3 than 90 days after the end of its tax year.  The certificate is
  8  4 valid for one year and shall include an expiration date.
  8  5    The certified supplier will be entitled to make an
  8  6 adjustment to its net income if it includes the valid,
  8  7 unexpired certificate with its tax return, and if its net
  8  8 business income allocated and apportioned to this state,
  8  9 computed without regard to the adjustment to net income
  8 10 provided in the bill, increased by more than 5 percent over
  8 11 its prior year net business income allocated and apportioned
  8 12 to this state.
  8 13    If both requirements are met, the certified supplier is
  8 14 entitled to subtract from its net income an amount equal to
  8 15 the difference between its current year net business income
  8 16 allocated and apportioned to this state, computed without
  8 17 regard to the adjustment to net income provided in the bill,
  8 18 and 105 percent of its prior year net business income allocated
  8 19 and apportioned to this state. This net income adjustment
  8 20 does not take into account any income attributable to an
  8 21 existing trade or business or income=producing contract
  8 22 which was acquired by the certified supplier through merger
  8 23 or acquisition during or after the first year for which
  8 24 the certified supplier became eligible for the net income
  8 25 adjustment.  Finally, the bill excludes this net income
  8 26 adjustment from the calculation of the school district income
  8 27 surtaxes in Code sections 257.21 (instructional support
  8 28 program), 257.29 (educational improvement program), and 298.2
  8 29 (physical plant and equipment levy), and the emergency medical
  8 30 services income surtax in Code chapter 422D, so that revenues
  8 31 from those taxes will not be reduced as a result of the net
  8 32 income adjustment.
  8 33    The economic development authority shall not issue
  8 34 certificates for tax years beginning on or after January 1,
  8 35 2020. The bill includes the certification program and its
  9  1 related income tax adjustments on the list of tax expenditures
  9  2 that the legislative tax expenditure committee is required to
  9  3 review during 2019.
  9  4    The bill provides the authority and department of revenue
  9  5 with rulemaking authority.
  9  6    The bill applies retroactively to January 1, 2017, for tax
  9  7 years beginning on or after that date.

  7 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 12    This bill creates an economic development program that
  7 13 allows a certified supplier to make an adjustment to net income
  7 14 for state individual and corporate income tax purposes. The
  7 15 adjustment is available for corporations and shareholders of
  7 16 subchapter S corporations.
  7 17    To qualify as a certified supplier under the bill, a business
  7 18 must meet several requirements.  The business must manufacture
  7 19 tangible personal property in Iowa but cannot be an anchor
  7 20 manufacturer.  The business must derive more than 10 percent
  7 21 of its gross sales from sales to anchor manufacturers, and all
  7 22 such sales must be arm's length transactions.  The business
  7 23 must supply the authority with signed statements from a certain
  7 24 number of anchor manufacturers attesting to certain information
  7 25 as prescribed in the bill and must agree to annually provide
  7 26 to the authority information and data on jobs and capital
  7 27 investments made in the state by the business.  Finally, the
  7 28 business must maintain at least 10 percent of its payroll in
  7 29 Iowa or employ at least 50 employees in Iowa.
  7 30    "Anchor manufacturer" is defined as a business that
  7 31 manufactures tangible personal property in Iowa and exports at
  7 32 least 50 percent of the tangible personal property manufactured
  7 33 in Iowa outside of the state.
  7 34    A business that meets all of the qualifications of a
  7 35 certified supplier may annually apply to the authority to
  8  1 receive a certificate labeling the business as a certified
  8  2 supplier.  A business must apply for a certificate no later
  8  3 than 90 days after the end of its tax year.  The certificate is
  8  4 valid for one year and shall include an expiration date.
  8  5    The certified supplier will be entitled to make an
  8  6 adjustment to its net income if it includes the valid,
  8  7 unexpired certificate with its tax return, and if its net
  8  8 business income allocated and apportioned to this state,
  8  9 computed without regard to the adjustment to net income
  8 10 provided in the bill, increased by more than 5 percent over
  8 11 its prior year net business income allocated and apportioned
  8 12 to this state.
  8 13    If both requirements are met, the certified supplier is
  8 14 entitled to subtract from its net income an amount equal to
  8 15 the difference between its current year net business income
  8 16 allocated and apportioned to this state, computed without
  8 17 regard to the adjustment to net income provided in the bill,
  8 18 and 105 percent of its prior year net business income allocated
  8 19 and apportioned to this state. This net income adjustment
  8 20 does not take into account any income attributable to an
  8 21 existing trade or business or income=producing contract
  8 22 which was acquired by the certified supplier through merger
  8 23 or acquisition during or after the first year for which
  8 24 the certified supplier became eligible for the net income
  8 25 adjustment.  Finally, the bill excludes this net income
  8 26 adjustment from the calculation of the school district income

  7 12    This bill creates an economic development program that
  7 13 allows a certified supplier to make an adjustment to net income
  7 14 for state individual and corporate income tax purposes. The
  7 15 adjustment is available for corporations and shareholders of
  7 16 subchapter S corporations.
  7 17    To qualify as a certified supplier under the bill, a business
  7 18 must meet several requirements.  The business must manufacture
  7 19 tangible personal property in Iowa but cannot be an anchor
  7 20 manufacturer.  The business must derive more than 10 percent
  7 21 of its gross sales from sales to anchor manufacturers, and all
  7 22 such sales must be arm's length transactions.  The business
  7 23 must supply the authority with signed statements from a certain
  7 24 number of anchor manufacturers attesting to certain information
  7 25 as prescribed in the bill and must agree to annually provide
  7 26 to the authority information and data on jobs and capital
  7 27 investments made in the state by the business.  Finally, the
  7 28 business must maintain at least 10 percent of its payroll in
  7 29 Iowa or employ at least 50 employees in Iowa.
  7 30    "Anchor manufacturer" is defined as a business that
  7 31 manufactures tangible personal property in Iowa and exports at
  7 32 least 50 percent of the tangible personal property manufactured
  7 33 in Iowa outside of the state.
  7 34    A business that meets all of the qualifications of a
  7 35 certified supplier may annually apply to the authority to
  8  1 receive a certificate labeling the business as a certified
  8  2 supplier.  A business must apply for a certificate no later
  8  3 than 90 days after the end of its tax year.  The certificate is
  8  4 valid for one year and shall include an expiration date.
  8  5    The certified supplier will be entitled to make an
  8  6 adjustment to its net income if it includes the valid,
  8  7 unexpired certificate with its tax return, and if its net
  8  8 business income allocated and apportioned to this state,
  8  9 computed without regard to the adjustment to net income
  8 10 provided in the bill, increased by more than 5 percent over
  8 11 its prior year net business income allocated and apportioned
  8 12 to this state.
  8 13    If both requirements are met, the certified supplier is
  8 14 entitled to subtract from its net income an amount equal to
  8 15 the difference between its current year net business income
  8 16 allocated and apportioned to this state, computed without
  8 17 regard to the adjustment to net income provided in the bill,
  8 18 and 105 percent of its prior year net business income allocated
  8 19 and apportioned to this state. This net income adjustment
  8 20 does not take into account any income attributable to an
  8 21 existing trade or business or income=producing contract
  8 22 which was acquired by the certified supplier through merger
  8 23 or acquisition during or after the first year for which
  8 24 the certified supplier became eligible for the net income
