 19 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 32    This bill relates to civil protective orders in sexual abuse
 19 33 cases, and makes penalties applicable.
 19 34    Under current law, a defendant accused of sexual abuse must
 19 35 be arrested for sexual abuse before a victim can apply for a
 20  1 criminal no=contact order against the defendant (Code section
 20  2 664A.3) or the victim can apply for a criminal no=contact order
 20  3 against a defendant upon the defendant's release from jail or
 20  4 prison (Code section 709.19).
 20  5    The bill creates new Code chapter 236A, the sexual abuse
 20  6 Act, allowing a victim of sexual abuse to seek relief from
 20  7 sexual abuse by filing a petition in district court for a
 20  8 sexual abuse civil protective order (emergency, temporary,
 20  9 or permanent) prior to the arrest of the defendant in such
 20 10 a situation affording the victim and the victim's family
 20 11 members, whose welfare may be affected by the sexual abuse
 20 12 situation, the same civil protections as victims of domestic
 20 13 abuse under Code chapter 236.  The bill defines sexual abuse as
 20 14 the commission of a crime defined in Code chapter 709 (sexual
 20 15 abuse) and Code sections 726.2 (incest) and 728.12 (sexual
 20 16 exploitation of a minor), and includes sexual abuse crimes
 20 17 in other jurisdictions under statutes that are substantially
 20 18 similar to the aforementioned statutes.
 20 19    Under the bill, upon a finding by the court, by a
 20 20 preponderance of the evidence, that a defendant has engaged in
 20 21 sexual abuse against the plaintiff, the court may order the
 20 22 defendant to cease the sexual abuse, and order the defendant
 20 23 to stay away from the plaintiff's residence, school, or place
 20 24 of employment. In seeking a protective order, a victim has
 20 25 the right to seek help from the court with or without the
 20 26 assistance of an attorney and without the payment of court
 20 27 costs.
 20 28    The bill requires criminal and juvenile justice agencies
 20 29 to collect and maintain information on incidents involving
 20 30 sexual abuse and to provide the information to the department
 20 31 of public safety.
 20 32    The bill makes conforming changes to Code provisions
 20 33 relating to the issuance of and violations of civil protective
 20 34 orders, the duties of the departments of justice and
 20 35 delinquency detention, insurance practices, court operating
 21  1 costs, and peace officer arrests.

 19 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 32    This bill relates to civil protective orders in sexual abuse
 19 33 cases, and makes penalties applicable.
 19 34    Under current law, a defendant accused of sexual abuse must
 19 35 be arrested for sexual abuse before a victim can apply for a
 20  1 criminal no=contact order against the defendant (Code section
 20  2 664A.3) or the victim can apply for a criminal no=contact order
 20  3 against a defendant upon the defendant's release from jail or
 20  4 prison (Code section 709.19).
 20  5    The bill creates new Code chapter 236A, the sexual abuse
 20  6 Act, allowing a victim of sexual abuse to seek relief from
 20  7 sexual abuse by filing a petition in district court for a
 20  8 sexual abuse civil protective order (emergency, temporary,
 20  9 or permanent) prior to the arrest of the defendant in such
 20 10 a situation affording the victim and the victim's family
 20 11 members, whose welfare may be affected by the sexual abuse
 20 12 situation, the same civil protections as victims of domestic
 20 13 abuse under Code chapter 236.  The bill defines sexual abuse as
 20 14 the commission of a crime defined in Code chapter 709 (sexual
 20 15 abuse) and Code sections 726.2 (incest) and 728.12 (sexual
 20 16 exploitation of a minor), and includes sexual abuse crimes
 20 17 in other jurisdictions under statutes that are substantially
 20 18 similar to the aforementioned statutes.
 20 19    Under the bill, upon a finding by the court, by a
 20 20 preponderance of the evidence, that a defendant has engaged in
 20 21 sexual abuse against the plaintiff, the court may order the
 20 22 defendant to cease the sexual abuse, and order the defendant
 20 23 to stay away from the plaintiff's residence, school, or place
 20 24 of employment. In seeking a protective order, a victim has
 20 25 the right to seek help from the court with or without the
 20 26 assistance of an attorney and without the payment of court
 20 27 costs.
 20 28    The bill requires criminal and juvenile justice agencies
 20 29 to collect and maintain information on incidents involving
 20 30 sexual abuse and to provide the information to the department
 20 31 of public safety.
 20 32    The bill makes conforming changes to Code provisions
 20 33 relating to the issuance of and violations of civil protective
 20 34 orders, the duties of the departments of justice and
 20 35 delinquency detention, insurance practices, court operating
 21  1 costs, and peace officer arrests.
