  4 18                           EXPLANATION
  4 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    This bill relates to sex offender registration requirements,
  4 22 sexually violent predators, and the commission of the offense
  4 23 of child endangerment.
  4 24    Currently, a person required to register as a sex offender
  4 25 is not required to register while incarcerated including while
  4 26 placed in a jail, prison, penitentiary, juvenile facility,
  4 27 or other correctional institution or facility.  The bill
  4 28 amends the definition of "incarcerated" in Code chapter 692A
  4 29 to specifically exclude placement in an adult residential
  4 30 correctional or treatment facility that allows a resident to
  4 31 leave the facility for a portion of a day or days.  By excluding
  4 32 placement in a residential correctional or treatment facility
  4 33 from the definition of "incarcerated", a sex offender placed
  4 34 in an adult residential correctional or treatment facility is
  4 35 required to register as a sex offender while placed at such a
  5  1 facility.
  5  2    The bill changes the definition of "sexually violent
  5  3 predator" in Code chapter 692A (sex offender registry) to mean
  5  4 a person who has been determined to be a sexually violent
  5  5 predator pursuant to Code section 229A.7 (civil commitment
  5  6 of sexually violent predator). Code section 229A.2 defines
  5  7 "sexually violent predator" to mean a person who has been
  5  8 convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who
  5  9 suffers from a mental abnormality which makes the person likely
  5 10 to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually violent
  5 11 offenses, if not confined in a secure facility.  A sexually
  5 12 violent predator is classified as a tier III offender under
  5 13 Code chapter 692A and must register as a sex offender for life.
  5 14    The bill amends Code section 692A.128 relating to the
  5 15 filing of an application to modify sex offender registration
  5 16 requirements. Currently, such an application shall not be
  5 17 granted unless the date of the commencement of the requirement
  5 18 to register occurred at least two years prior to the filing of
  5 19 the application for a tier I offender and five years prior to
  5 20 the filing of the application for a tier II or III offender.
  5 21    The bill provides that an application to modify the
  5 22 registration requirements by a tier I offender may be granted
  5 23 if the requirement to register occurred at least 10 years prior
  5 24 to the filing of the application, and for a tier III offender
  5 25 such an application may be granted if the requirement to
  5 26 register occurred at least 25 years prior to the filing of the
  5 27 application.  A tier II offender under the bill is no longer
  5 28 eligible to file an application to modify the registration
  5 29 requirements.
  5 30    The bill and current law require other conditions be met
  5 31 prior to granting an application to modify sex offender
  5 32 registration requirements.  The bill requires the applicant to
  5 33 have successfully completed any period of probation, parole,
  5 34 or other supervised release without incurring a revocation
  5 35 of probation, parole, or other supervised release.  The bill
  6  1 requires the applicant to have no other criminal convictions
  6  2 other than simple misdemeanor violations of Code chapter 321
  6  3 or similar local violations for a 10=year period for tier I
  6  4 offenders and for a 25=year period for tier III offenders
  6  5 required to register as juvenile offenders.  The bill strikes
  6  6 the requirements that an applicant be assessed as a low risk to
  6  7 reoffend and that the applicant's supervising agency stipulate
  6  8 to the modification.
  6  9    If the application is granted, the bill allows the court to
  6 10 modify the registration period by reducing the registration
  6 11 period by up to five years for a tier I offender and by allowing
  6 12 the court to modify the registration period of a tier III
  6 13 offender to a term of years.
  6 14    The bill modifies the criminal offense of child endangerment
  6 15 when allowing a sex offender access to a child or certain
  6 16 minors.  The bill specifies that a parent or guardian, or
  6 17 person having custody or control over a child or a minor
  6 18 under the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability, or
  6 19 a person who is a member of the household in which a child
  6 20 or such a minor resides, commits child endangerment, if the
  6 21 person knowingly allows a person custody or control of, or
  6 22 unsupervised access to a child or a minor after knowing the
  6 23 person is required to register due to a conviction for a sex
  6 24 offense against a minor or is on the sex offender registry due
  6 25 to a conviction for a sex offense against a minor under Code
  6 26 chapter 692A.
  6 27    The bill also specifies that a person who knowingly takes
  6 28 such custody or control or has such unsupervised access commits
  6 29 child endangerment but does not commit such child endangerment,
  6 30 if the person is the parent or guardian of the child or minor
  6 31 and the parent or guardian is required to register as a sex
  6 32 offender due to a conviction for a sex offense against a
  6 33 minor, or if the person is married to and living with a person
  6 34 required to register as a sex offender due to a conviction for
  6 35 a sex offense against a minor.
  7  1 The penalties for a person who commits child endangerment
  7  2 range from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "B" felony
  7  3 punishable by up to 50 years in prison.

  4 34 in an adult residential correctional or treatment facility is
  4 35 required to register as a sex offender while placed at such a
  5  1 facility.
  5  2    The bill changes the definition of "sexually violent

  5  4 a person who has been determined to be a sexually violent
  5  5 predator pursuant to Code section 229A.7 (civil commitment

  5 11 offenses, if not confined in a secure facility.  A sexually
  5 12 violent predator is classified as a tier III offender under

  5 14    The bill amends Code section 692A.128 relating to the

  5 16 requirements. Currently, such an application shall not be

  5 20 the filing of the application for a tier II or III offender.
  5 21    The bill provides that an application to modify the
  5 22 registration requirements by a tier I offender may be granted
  5 23 if the requirement to register occurred at least 10 years prior
  5 24 to the filing of the application, and for a tier III offender
  5 25 such an application may be granted if the requirement to
  5 26 register occurred at least 25 years prior to the filing of the
  5 27 application.  A tier II offender under the bill is no longer
  5 28 eligible to file an application to modify the registration
  5 29 requirements.
  5 30    The bill and current law require other conditions be met
  5 31 prior to granting an application to modify sex offender

  6  1 requires the applicant to have no other criminal convictions

  6  9    If the application is granted, the bill allows the court to
  6 10 modify the registration period by reducing the registration
  6 11 period by up to five years for a tier I offender and by allowing
  6 12 the court to modify the registration period of a tier III
  6 13 offender to a term of years.
  6 14    The bill modifies the criminal offense of child endangerment
  6 15 when allowing a sex offender access to a child or certain
  6 16 minors.  The bill specifies that a parent or guardian, or
  6 17 person having custody or control over a child or a minor
  6 18 under the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability, or
  6 19 a person who is a member of the household in which a child
  6 20 or such a minor resides, commits child endangerment, if the

  6 27    The bill also specifies that a person who knowingly takes

  6 29 child endangerment but does not commit such child endangerment,
  6 30 if the person is the parent or guardian of the child or minor

  4 22 sexually violent predators, and the commission of the offense
  4 23 of child endangerment.
  4 24    Currently, a person required to register as a sex offender
  4 25 is not required to register while incarcerated including while
  4 26 placed in a jail, prison, penitentiary, juvenile facility,
  4 27 or other correctional institution or facility.  The bill
  4 28 amends the definition of "incarcerated" in Code chapter 692A
  4 29 to specifically exclude placement in an adult residential
  4 30 correctional or treatment facility that allows a resident to
  4 31 leave the facility for a portion of a day or days.  By excluding
  4 32 placement in a residential correctional or treatment facility
  4 33 from the definition of "incarcerated", a sex offender placed
  4 34 in an adult residential correctional or treatment facility is
  4 35 required to register as a sex offender while placed at such a
  5  1 facility.
  5  2    The bill changes the definition of "sexually violent
  5  3 predator" in Code chapter 692A (sex offender registry) to mean
  5  4 a person who has been determined to be a sexually violent
  5  5 predator pursuant to Code section 229A.7 (civil commitment
  5  6 of sexually violent predator). Code section 229A.2 defines
  5  7 "sexually violent predator" to mean a person who has been
  5  8 convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who
  5  9 suffers from a mental abnormality which makes the person likely
  5 10 to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually violent
  5 11 offenses, if not confined in a secure facility.  A sexually
  5 12 violent predator is classified as a tier III offender under
  5 13 Code chapter 692A and must register as a sex offender for life.
  5 14    The bill amends Code section 692A.128 relating to the
  5 15 filing of an application to modify sex offender registration
  5 16 requirements. Currently, such an application shall not be
  5 17 granted unless the date of the commencement of the requirement
  5 18 to register occurred at least two years prior to the filing of
  5 19 the application for a tier I offender and five years prior to
  5 20 the filing of the application for a tier II or III offender.
  5 21    The bill provides that an application to modify the
  5 22 registration requirements by a tier I offender may be granted
  5 23 if the requirement to register occurred at least 10 years prior
  5 24 to the filing of the application, and for a tier III offender
  5 25 such an application may be granted if the requirement to
  5 26 register occurred at least 25 years prior to the filing of the
  5 27 application.  A tier II offender under the bill is no longer
  5 28 eligible to file an application to modify the registration
  5 29 requirements.
  5 30    The bill and current law require other conditions be met
  5 31 prior to granting an application to modify sex offender
  5 32 registration requirements.  The bill requires the applicant to
  5 33 have successfully completed any period of probation, parole,
  5 34 or other supervised release without incurring a revocation
  5 35 of probation, parole, or other supervised release.  The bill
  6  1 requires the applicant to have no other criminal convictions
  6  2 other than simple misdemeanor violations of Code chapter 321
  6  3 or similar local violations for a 10=year period for tier I
  6  4 offenders and for a 25=year period for tier III offenders
  6  5 required to register as juvenile offenders.  The bill strikes
  6  6 the requirements that an applicant be assessed as a low risk to
  6  7 reoffend and that the applicant's supervising agency stipulate
  6  8 to the modification.
  6  9    If the application is granted, the bill allows the court to
  6 10 modify the registration period by reducing the registration
  6 11 period by up to five years for a tier I offender and by allowing
  6 12 the court to modify the registration period of a tier III
  6 13 offender to a term of years.
  6 14    The bill modifies the criminal offense of child endangerment
  6 15 when allowing a sex offender access to a child or certain
  6 16 minors.  The bill specifies that a parent or guardian, or
  6 17 person having custody or control over a child or a minor
  6 18 under the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability, or
  6 19 a person who is a member of the household in which a child
  6 20 or such a minor resides, commits child endangerment, if the
  6 21 person knowingly allows a person custody or control of, or
  6 22 unsupervised access to a child or a minor after knowing the
  6 23 person is required to register due to a conviction for a sex
  6 24 offense against a minor or is on the sex offender registry due
  6 25 to a conviction for a sex offense against a minor under Code
  6 26 chapter 692A.
  6 27    The bill also specifies that a person who knowingly takes
  6 28 such custody or control or has such unsupervised access commits
  6 29 child endangerment but does not commit such child endangerment,
  6 30 if the person is the parent or guardian of the child or minor
  6 31 and the parent or guardian is required to register as a sex
  6 32 offender due to a conviction for a sex offense against a
  6 33 minor, or if the person is married to and living with a person
  6 34 required to register as a sex offender due to a conviction for
  6 35 a sex offense against a minor.
  7  1 The penalties for a person who commits child endangerment
  7  2 range from an aggravated misdemeanor to a class "B" felony
  7  3 punishable by up to 50 years in prison.

  6 16 minors.  The bill specifies that a parent or guardian, or
  6 17 person having custody or control over a child or a minor
  6 18 under the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability, or
  6 19 a person who is a member of the household in which a child
  6 20 or such a minor resides, commits child endangerment, if the
  6 21 person knowingly allows a person custody or control of, or
  6 22 unsupervised access to a child or a minor after knowing the
  6 23 person is required to register due to a conviction for a sex
  6 24 offense against a minor or is on the sex offender registry due
  6 25 to a conviction for a sex offense against a minor under Code
  6 26 chapter 692A.
  6 27    The bill also specifies that a person who knowingly takes
  6 28 such custody or control or has such unsupervised access commits
  6 29 child endangerment but does not commit such child endangerment,
  6 30 if the person is the parent or guardian of the child or minor
  6 31 and the parent or guardian is required to register as a sex
  6 32 offender due to a conviction for a sex offense against a
  6 33 minor, or if the person is married to and living with a person
  6 34 required to register as a sex offender due to a conviction for
  6 35 a sex offense against a minor.

  4 24    Currently, a person required to register as a sex offender
  4 25 is not required to register while incarcerated including while
  4 26 placed in a jail, prison, penitentiary, juvenile facility,
  4 27 or other correctional institution or facility.  The bill
  4 28 amends the definition of "incarcerated" in Code chapter 692A
  4 29 to specifically exclude placement in an adult residential
  4 30 correctional or treatment facility that allows a resident to
  4 31 leave the facility for a portion of a day or days.  By excluding
  4 32 placement in a residential correctional or treatment facility
  4 33 from the definition of "incarcerated", a sex offender placed
  4 34 in an adult residential correctional or treatment facility is
  4 35 required to register as a sex offender while placed at such a
  5  1 facility.
  5  2    The bill changes the definition of "sexually violent
  5  3 predator" in Code chapter 692A (sex offender registry) to mean
  5  4 a person who has been determined to be a sexually violent
  5  5 predator pursuant to Code section 229A.7 (civil commitment
  5  6 of sexually violent predator). Code section 229A.2 defines
  5  7 "sexually violent predator" to mean a person who has been
  5  8 convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who
  5  9 suffers from a mental abnormality which makes the person likely
  5 10 to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually violent
  5 11 offenses, if not confined in a secure facility.  A sexually
  5 12 violent predator is classified as a tier III offender under
  5 13 Code chapter 692A and must register as a sex offender for life.
  5 14    The bill amends Code section 692A.128 relating to the
  5 15 filing of an application to modify sex offender registration
  5 16 requirements. Currently, such an application shall not be
  5 17 granted unless the date of the commencement of the requirement
  5 18 to register occurred at least two years prior to the filing of
  5 19 the application for a tier I offender and five years prior to
  5 20 the filing of the application for a tier II or III offender.
  5 21    The bill provides that an application to modify the
  5 22 registration requirements by a tier I offender may be granted
  5 23 if the requirement to register occurred at least 10 years prior
  5 24 to the filing of the application, and for a tier III offender
  5 25 such an application may be granted if the requirement to
  5 26 register occurred at least 25 years prior to the filing of the
  5 27 application.  A tier II offender under the bill is no longer
  5 28 eligible to file an application to modify the registration
  5 29 requirements.
  5 30    The bill and current law require other conditions be met
  5 31 prior to granting an application to modify sex offender
  5 32 registration requirements.  The bill requires the applicant to
  5 33 have successfully completed any period of probation, parole,
  5 34 or other supervised release without incurring a revocation
  5 35 of probation, parole, or other supervised release.  The bill
  6  1 requires the applicant to have no other criminal convictions
  6  2 other than simple misdemeanor violations of Code chapter 321
  6  3 or similar local violations for a 10=year period for tier I
  6  4 offenders and for a 25=year period for tier III offenders
  6  5 required to register as juvenile offenders.  The bill strikes
  6  6 the requirements that an applicant be assessed as a low risk to
  6  7 reoffend and that the applicant's supervising agency stipulate
  6  8 to the modification.
  6  9    If the application is granted, the bill allows the court to
  6 10 modify the registration period by reducing the registration
  6 11 period by up to five years for a tier I offender and by allowing
  6 12 the court to modify the registration period of a tier III
  6 13 offender to a term of years.
  6 14    The bill modifies the criminal offense of child endangerment
  6 15 when allowing a sex offender access to a child or certain
  6 16 minors.  The bill specifies that a parent or guardian, or
  6 17 person having custody or control over a child or a minor
  6 18 under the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability, or
  6 19 a person who is a member of the household in which a child
  6 20 or such a minor resides, commits child endangerment, if the
  6 21 person knowingly allows a person custody or control of, or
  6 22 unsupervised access to a child or a minor after knowing the
  6 23 person is required to register due to a conviction for a sex
  6 24 offense against a minor or is on the sex offender registry due
  6 25 to a conviction for a sex offense against a minor under Code
  6 26 chapter 692A.
  6 27    The bill also specifies that a person who knowingly takes
  6 28 such custody or control or has such unsupervised access commits
  6 29 child endangerment but does not commit such child endangerment,
  6 30 if the person is the parent or guardian of the child or minor
  6 31 and the parent or guardian is required to register as a sex
  6 32 offender due to a conviction for a sex offense against a
  6 33 minor, or if the person is married to and living with a person
  6 34 required to register as a sex offender due to a conviction for
  6 35 a sex offense against a minor.

  4 25 is not required to register while incarcerated including while
  4 26 placed in a jail, prison, penitentiary, juvenile facility,

  4 28 amends the definition of "incarcerated" in Code chapter 692A
  4 29 to specifically exclude placement in an adult residential
  4 30 correctional or treatment facility that allows a resident to
  4 31 leave the facility for a portion of a day or days.  By excluding
  4 32 placement in a residential correctional or treatment facility
  4 33 from the definition of "incarcerated", a sex offender placed
  4 34 in an adult residential correctional or treatment facility is
  4 35 required to register as a sex offender while placed at such a

  5  4 a person who has been determined to be a sexually violent
  5  5 predator pursuant to Code section 229A.7 (civil commitment
  5  6 of sexually violent predator). Code section 229A.2 defines

  5  9 suffers from a mental abnormality which makes the person likely
  5 10 to engage in predatory acts constituting sexually violent
  5 11 offenses, if not confined in a secure facility.  A sexually
  5 12 violent predator is classified as a tier III offender under

  5 14    The bill amends Code section 692A.128 relating to the
  5 15 filing of an application to modify sex offender registration

  5 17 granted unless the date of the commencement of the requirement
  5 18 to register occurred at least two years prior to the filing of
  5 19 the application for a tier I offender and five years prior to
  5 20 the filing of the application for a tier II or III offender.
  5 21    The bill provides that an application to modify the
  5 22 registration requirements by a tier I offender may be granted
  5 23 if the requirement to register occurred at least 10 years prior
  5 24 to the filing of the application, and for a tier III offender
  5 25 such an application may be granted if the requirement to
  5 26 register occurred at least 25 years prior to the filing of the
  5 27 application.  A tier II offender under the bill is no longer
  5 28 eligible to file an application to modify the registration
  5 29 requirements.
  5 30    The bill and current law require other conditions be met
  5 31 prior to granting an application to modify sex offender
  5 32 registration requirements.  The bill requires the applicant to
  5 33 have successfully completed any period of probation, parole,
  5 34 or other supervised release without incurring a revocation
  5 35 of probation, parole, or other supervised release.  The bill
  6  1 requires the applicant to have no other criminal convictions
  6  2 other than simple misdemeanor violations of Code chapter 321
  6  3 or similar local violations for a 10=year period for tier I
  6  4 offenders and for a 25=year period for tier III offenders

  6 14    The bill modifies the criminal offense of child endangerment
  6 15 when allowing a sex offender access to a child or certain
  6 16 minors.  The bill specifies that a parent or guardian, or
  6 17 person having custody or control over a child or a minor
  6 18 under the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability, or
  6 19 a person who is a member of the household in which a child

  6 24 offense against a minor or is on the sex offender registry due
  6 25 to a conviction for a sex offense against a minor under Code
