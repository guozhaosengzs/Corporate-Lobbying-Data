  3 20    NOTICE.  This direct primary care agreement is not health

  3 22 for purposes of any federal mandates. This direct primary
  3 23 care agreement only covers the primary care health services
  3 24 described in this agreement. It is recommended that you obtain
  3 25 health insurance to cover health care services not covered
  3 26 under this direct primary care agreement. You are personally
  3 27 responsible for the payment of any additional health care
  3 28 expenses you may incur.
  3 29    b.  The direct provider shall provide the direct patient, or
  3 30 the direct patient's representative, with a fully executed copy
  3 31 of the direct primary care agreement at the time the direct
  3 32 primary care agreement is executed.
  3 33    3.  Application for a direct primary care agreement.  If
  3 34 a direct provider requires a prospective direct patient to
  3 35 complete an application for a direct primary care agreement,
  4  1 the direct provider shall provide a written disclaimer on each
  4  2 application that informs the prospective direct patient of the
  4  3 direct patient's financial rights and responsibilities and
  4  4 that states that the direct provider will not bill a health
  4  5 insurance carrier for primary care health services covered
  4  6 under the direct primary care agreement. The disclaimer shall
  4  7 also include the identical notice required by subsection 2,
  4  8 paragraph "a", subparagraph (11).
  4  9    4.  Notice required for changes to the terms or conditions of
  4 10 a direct primary care agreement.
  4 11    a.  A direct provider shall provide at least a
  4 12 sixty=calendar=day advance, written notice to a direct patient
  4 13 of any of the following changes to a direct primary care
  4 14 agreement:
  4 15    (1)  Any change in the scope of the primary care health
  4 16 services covered under the agreement.
  4 17    (2)  Any change in the direct provider's locations where the
  4 18 direct patient may access primary care health services.
  4 19    (3)  Any change in the out=of=office services that are
  4 20 covered under the direct primary care service agreement.

  4 26    b.  A direct provider shall provide the notice by mailing
  4 27 a letter to the address of the direct patient that the direct
  4 28 provider has on file. The postmark date on the letter shall be
  4 29 the first day of the required sixty=calendar=day notice period.
  4 30    5.  Discrimination based on an individual's health status.  A
  4 31 direct provider shall not refuse to accept a new direct patient
  4 32 or discontinue care of an existing direct patient based solely
  4 33 on the new direct patient's or the existing direct patient's
  4 34 health status.
  4 35    6.  A direct primary care agreement is not insurance.
  5  1    a.  A direct primary care agreement is not insurance and
  5  2 shall not be subject to the authority of the commissioner of
  5  3 insurance. Neither a direct care provider, nor an agent of
  5  4 a direct care provider, shall be required to be licensed by
  5  5 the commissioner to transact the business of insurance in this
  5  6 state or to obtain a certificate issued by the commissioner to
  5  7 market or offer a direct primary care agreement.
  5  8    b.  A direct provider shall not bill an insurer for a service
  5  9 provided under a direct primary care agreement. A direct
  5 10 patient may submit a request for reimbursement to an insurer if
  5 11 permitted under the direct patient's policy of insurance. This
  5 12 paragraph does not prohibit a direct provider from billing a
  5 13 direct patient's insurance for a service provided to the direct
  5 14 patient by the direct provider that is not provided under the
  5 15 direct primary care agreement.
  5 16    7.  Third=party payment of a direct service charge.  A direct
  5 17 provider may accept payment of a direct service charge for
  5 18 a direct patient either directly or indirectly from a third
  5 19 party. A direct provider may accept all or part of a direct
  5 20 service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an employee who
  5 21 is a direct patient of the direct provider. A direct provider
  5 22 shall not enter directly into an agreement with an employer
  5 23 relating to a direct primary care agreement between the direct
  5 24 provider and employees of the employer, other than an agreement
  5 25 to establish the timing and method of the payment of a direct
  5 26 service charge paid by the employer on behalf of the employee.
  5 27    8.  Sale or transfer of a direct primary care agreement.  A
  5 28 direct primary care agreement shall not be sold or transferred
  5 29 by a direct care provider without the prior written consent
  5 30 of the direct patient who is a party to the direct primary
  5 31 care agreement. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  5 32 direct primary care agreement to which the direct patient is a
  5 33 party.
  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must

  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each

  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a

  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  4  6 under the direct primary care agreement. The disclaimer shall
  4  7 also include the identical notice required by subsection 2,
  4  8 paragraph "a", subparagraph (11).

  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must

  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each

  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify

  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing

  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  4  6 under the direct primary care agreement. The disclaimer shall
  4  7 also include the identical notice required by subsection 2,

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that

  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least

  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a

  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  4  6 under the direct primary care agreement. The disclaimer shall
  4  7 also include the identical notice required by subsection 2,
  4  8 paragraph "a", subparagraph (11).

  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to

  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least

  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to

  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each

  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a

  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement

  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.

  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between

  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as

  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to

  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least

  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must

  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each

  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct

  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.

  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the

  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.

  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each

  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a

  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.

  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of

  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an

  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.

  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between

  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.

  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least

  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.

  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between

  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the

  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between

  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of

  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a

  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to

  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the

  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least

  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a

  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must

  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each

  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that

  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least

  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a

  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  3  4 patient or to the direct patient's representative.

  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a

  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.

  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the

  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.

  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing

  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the

  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.

  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a

  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as

  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that

  3 34 a direct provider requires a prospective direct patient to
  3 35 complete an application for a direct primary care agreement,
  4  1 the direct provider shall provide a written disclaimer on each
  4  2 application that informs the prospective direct patient of the
  4  3 direct patient's financial rights and responsibilities and
  4  4 that states that the direct provider will not bill a health
  4  5 insurance carrier for primary care health services covered
  4  6 under the direct primary care agreement. The disclaimer shall
  4  7 also include the identical notice required by subsection 2,
  4  8 paragraph "a", subparagraph (11).
  4  9    4.  Notice required for changes to the terms or conditions of
  4 10 a direct primary care agreement.

  4 33 on the new direct patient's or the existing direct patient's
  4 34 health status.
  4 35    6.  A direct primary care agreement is not insurance.
  5  1    a.  A direct primary care agreement is not insurance and

  5 12 paragraph does not prohibit a direct provider from billing a
  5 13 direct patient's insurance for a service provided to the direct
  5 14 patient by the direct provider that is not provided under the
  5 15 direct primary care agreement.
  5 16    7.  Third=party payment of a direct service charge.  A direct

  5 23 relating to a direct primary care agreement between the direct
  5 24 provider and employees of the employer, other than an agreement
  5 25 to establish the timing and method of the payment of a direct

  5 27    8.  Sale or transfer of a direct primary care agreement.  A
  5 28 direct primary care agreement shall not be sold or transferred
  5 29 by a direct care provider without the prior written consent
  5 30 of the direct patient who is a party to the direct primary
  5 31 care agreement. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a

  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  4  6 under the direct primary care agreement. The disclaimer shall
  4  7 also include the identical notice required by subsection 2,

  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a
  8  6 direct primary care agreement.

  5 15 direct primary care agreement.
  5 16    7.  Third=party payment of a direct service charge.  A direct

  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,

  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must

  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.

  5 34                           EXPLANATION
  5 35 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  1 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  2    This bill relates to agreements between individuals and
  6  3 health care professionals for the provision of certain primary
  6  4 care health services for a service charge that covers an agreed
  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as
  6 15 defined in the bill, provided by a direct provider to a direct
  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,
  6 17 a subscription fee, or other charge paid by a direct patient to
  6 18 a direct provider.
  6 19    The bill requires that a direct primary care agreement must
  6 20 be in writing, must be signed by the direct provider and the
  6 21 direct patient, must describe the scope of the primary care
  6 22 health services included under the agreement, must state each
  6 23 direct provider location where primary care health services may
  6 24 be obtained by a direct patient, must specify any out=of=office
  6 25 services that are included under the agreement, must specify
  6 26 the direct service charge and how often it must be paid, must
  6 27 specify any additional costs that may be assessed to the direct
  6 28 patient for primary care health services not covered by the
  6 29 direct service charge, and it must specify the duration of the
  6 30 direct primary care agreement and how the agreement is renewed.
  6 31    The bill requires that the terms and conditions for
  6 32 termination of the direct primary care agreement by the direct
  6 33 provider or the direct patient be included in the agreement.
  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.
  7  8    A direct provider shall give a copy of the executed direct
  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least
  7 11 a 60=calendar=day advance, written notice to an existing
  7 12 direct patient of changes, as outlined in the bill, to a
  7 13 direct primary care service agreement. A direct provider is
  7 14 prohibited from refusing to accept a new direct patient or
  7 15 discontinuing care for an existing direct patient based solely
  7 16 on the patient's health status.
  7 17    The bill provides that a direct primary care agreement
  7 18 is not insurance and is not subject to the authority of the
  7 19 commissioner of insurance. A direct care provider is not
  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.
  7 24    The bill prohibits a direct provider from billing an insurer
  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 26 A direct patient may submit a request for reimbursement to
  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a
  8  4 primary care agreement with the prior written consent of the
  8  5 direct patient. A direct patient shall not sell or transfer a

  6  5 upon period of time.
  6  6    The bill defines a direct primary care agreement as an
  6  7 agreement between a direct provider and a direct patient,
  6  8 or the direct patient's representative, in which the direct
  6  9 provider agrees to provide primary care health services to
  6 10 the direct patient for a direct service charge for the period
  6 11 of time designated in the agreement. A direct patient is an
  6 12 individual, or an individual and the individual's immediate
  6 13 family. A direct provider is defined in the bill. A direct
  6 14 service charge is a charge for primary care health services, as

  6 16 patient and may include a periodic retainer, a membership fee,

  6 34    The bill requires that a notice be included on the direct
  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
  7  1 agreement is not health insurance and is not a plan that
  7  2 provides health coverage for purposes of any federal mandates.
  7  3 The notice advises that the agreement only covers the primary
  7  4 care health services described in the agreement and recommends
  7  5 that the direct patient obtain health insurance to cover other
  7  6 health care services as the patient is responsible for all
  7  7 additional expenses incurred.

  7  9 primary care agreement to the direct patient.
  7 10    The bill requires a direct provider to give at least

  7 20 required to be licensed by the commissioner to transact the
  7 21 business of insurance in this state, or to obtain a certificate
  7 22 issued by the commissioner to market or offer a direct primary
  7 23 care agreement.

  7 25 for services provided under a direct primary care agreement.

  7 27 an insurer if permitted under the direct patient's policy of
  7 28 insurance. A direct provider may bill a direct patient's
  7 29 insurance for services provided by the direct provider that are
  7 30 not provided under a direct primary care agreement.
  7 31    A direct provider may accept payment of a direct service
  7 32 charge for a direct patient either directly or indirectly from
  7 33 a third party. A direct provider may accept all or part of
  7 34 a direct service charge paid by an employer on behalf of an
  7 35 employee but may not enter directly into an agreement with an
  8  1 employer relating to a direct primary care agreement between
  8  2 the direct provider and employees of that employer.
  8  3    The bill allows a direct provider to sell or transfer a

  6 35 primary care agreement and application that advises that the
