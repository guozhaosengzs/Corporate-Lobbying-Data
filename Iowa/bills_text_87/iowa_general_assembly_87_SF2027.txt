  1 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 33    Under current law, a person who is an honorably discharged
  1 34 veteran of the armed forces of the United States may request
  1 35 that the person's driver's license be marked to reflect the
  2  1 person's veteran status. Such a license is required to be
  2  2 issued upon receipt of satisfactory proof of veteran status
  2  3 pursuant to procedures established by the department of
  2  4 transportation (DOT) in consultation with the department of
  2  5 veterans affairs (DVA), or upon presentation of the person's
  2  6 certification of release or discharge from active duty, DD form
  2  7 214, to the DOT.  The procedures established by the DOT (761
  2  8 IAC 605.2) require a person who was a member of the national
  2  9 guard or reserve forces and who applies directly to the DOT
  2 10 to present a DD form 214 which indicates that the person was
  2 11 honorably discharged after serving for at least a minimum
  2 12 aggregate of 90 days of active duty service for purposes other
  2 13 than training. A person who was a member of the national
  2 14 guard or reserve forces and who has a discharge document other
  2 15 than a DD form 214 must have the person's eligibility for a
  2 16 veteran designation determined by a designee of the Iowa DVA
  2 17 and is required to apply to the DVA for a veteran designation
  2 18 by submitting form 432035. Form 432035 requires the person
  2 19 to meet the definition of "veteran" set forth in Code section
  2 20 35.1. Code section 35.1 defines "veteran" to mean, in part, a
  2 21 member of the reserve forces of the United States who completed
  2 22 a minimum aggregate of 90 days of federal active duty other
  2 23 than training and was discharged under honorable conditions,
  2 24 and a member of the Iowa national guard who was activated for
  2 25 federal duty other than training for a minimum aggregate of 90
  2 26 days and was discharged under honorable conditions.
  2 27    This bill provides that for purposes of a driver's license
  2 28 marked to reflect veteran status, "veteran" means as defined
  2 29 in Code section 35.1 but also includes any member of the
  2 30 reserve forces of the United States discharged under honorable
  2 31 conditions and any member of the Iowa national guard discharged
  2 32 under honorable conditions regardless of the aggregate number
  2 33 of days of federal active duty served by the member and
  2 34 regardless of whether the member was activated for federal
  2 35 duty.
