  4 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 18    This bill amends Code section 321.299 to require the driver
  4 19 of a vehicle overtaking a person riding a bicycle proceeding
  4 20 in the same direction on a roadway to pass to the left of the
  4 21 bicycle in an adjacent travel lane or on the opposite side of
  4 22 the roadway, and prohibits the driver from returning to the
  4 23 right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken
  4 24 bicycle in accordance with Code section 321.281. Code section
  4 25 321.281 prohibits a person operating a vehicle from steering
  4 26 the vehicle unreasonably close to or toward a person riding
  4 27 a bicycle on a highway. This provision of the bill does not
  4 28 apply if the bicycle is traveling on a paved shoulder or in a
  4 29 lane designated for the travel of bicycles.
  4 30    A violation of Code section 321.281 is punishable by a
  4 31 scheduled fine of $250 and a violation of Code section 321.299
  4 32 is punishable by a scheduled fine of $100. However, if a
  4 33 violation of Code section 321.299 causes a serious injury, a
  4 34 court could impose an additional fine of $500 and suspend the
  4 35 person's driver's license for not more than 90 days. If the
  5  1 violation causes a death, a court could impose an additional
  5  2 fine of $1,000 and suspend the person's driver's license for
  5  3 not more than 180 days.
  5  4    Under Code section 321.234, a person riding a bicycle on the
  5  5 highway is subject to the provisions of Code chapter 321 (motor
  5  6 vehicles and law of the road) and has all the rights and duties
  5  7 applicable to the driver of a vehicle. The bill specifies
  5  8 that under Code section 321.304 a vehicle is prohibited from
  5  9 overtaking and passing a bicycle when approaching the crest of
  5 10 a grade or upon a curve in the highway where the driver's view
  5 11 along the highway is obstructed for a distance of approximately
  5 12 700 feet; when approaching within 100 feet of any narrow
  5 13 bridge, viaduct, or tunnel; or when approaching within 100 feet
  5 14 of or traversing any intersection or railroad grade crossing.
  5 15 However, the bill provides that a vehicle may pass a bicycle
  5 16 where official signs are in place directing that traffic keep
  5 17 to the right or a distinctive center line or off=center line
  5 18 is marked, provided the vehicle complies with the current
  5 19 requirements for overtaking on the left.
  5 20    A violation of Code section 321.304 is punishable by a
  5 21 scheduled fine of $100. However, if the violation causes a
  5 22 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  5 23 and suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  5 24 days. If the violation causes a death, a court could impose
  5 25 an additional fine of $1,000 and suspend the person's driver's
  5 26 license for not more than 180 days.
  5 27    Current law requires a bicycle to have a front lighted
  5 28 lamp and either a rear lighted lamp or a rear reflector at
  5 29 any time from sunset to sunrise, and at such other times
  5 30 when conditions such as fog, snow, sleet, or rain provide
  5 31 insufficient lighting to render clearly discernible persons and
  5 32 vehicles on the highway at a distance of 500 feet ahead. The
  5 33 bill instead requires that, from sunset to sunrise, a bicycle
  5 34 must be equipped with a lamp on the front exhibiting a steady
  5 35 or flashing white light visible from a distance of at least 300
  6  1 feet to the front, and every bicycle or bicycle rider must be
  6  2 equipped with a lamp exhibiting a steady or flashing red light
  6  3 visible from a distance of 300 feet to the rear.
  6  4    The scheduled fine for a violation of this provision is $25.
  6  5 However, the bill provides that a citation issued for failure
  6  6 to have a front or rear lamp on a bicycle or on a bicycle rider
  6  7 must first provide for a 72=hour period within which the person
  6  8 charged with the violation can replace or repair the lamp. If
  6  9 the person complies with the directive to replace or repair the
  6 10 bicycle lamp, the citation must be expunged.
  6 11    The bill requires a person riding a bicycle on a highway
  6 12 with a speed limit of 45 miles per hour or more, other than
  6 13 for the purpose of crossing the highway at a crosswalk, to
  6 14 wear clothing and equipment which together contain at least
  6 15 144 square inches of high=visibility or reflective material
  6 16 visible to the rear of the bicycle. The scheduled fine for a
  6 17 violation of this provision is $25. The bill provides that
  6 18 the provision does not apply to a person riding a bicycle as
  6 19 part of an organized bicycle riding event involving 500 or more
  6 20 bicycle riders at which one or more certified peace officers
  6 21 are providing traffic control and direction.

  4 23 right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken
  4 24 bicycle in accordance with Code section 321.281. Code section
  4 25 321.281 prohibits a person operating a vehicle from steering
  4 26 the vehicle unreasonably close to or toward a person riding
  4 27 a bicycle on a highway. This provision of the bill does not
  4 28 apply if the bicycle is traveling on a paved shoulder or in a
  4 29 lane designated for the travel of bicycles.
  4 30    A violation of Code section 321.281 is punishable by a
  4 31 scheduled fine of $250 and a violation of Code section 321.299
  4 32 is punishable by a scheduled fine of $100. However, if a
  4 33 violation of Code section 321.299 causes a serious injury, a
  4 34 court could impose an additional fine of $500 and suspend the
  4 35 person's driver's license for not more than 90 days. If the
  5  1 violation causes a death, a court could impose an additional
  5  2 fine of $1,000 and suspend the person's driver's license for
  5  3 not more than 180 days.
  5  4    Under Code section 321.234, a person riding a bicycle on the

  5 18 is marked, provided the vehicle complies with the current
  5 19 requirements for overtaking on the left.
  5 20    A violation of Code section 321.304 is punishable by a
  5 21 scheduled fine of $100. However, if the violation causes a
  5 22 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  5 23 and suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  5 24 days. If the violation causes a death, a court could impose
  5 25 an additional fine of $1,000 and suspend the person's driver's
  5 26 license for not more than 180 days.
  5 27    Current law requires a bicycle to have a front lighted
  5 28 lamp and either a rear lighted lamp or a rear reflector at

  5 30 when conditions such as fog, snow, sleet, or rain provide

  5 35 or flashing white light visible from a distance of at least 300
  6  1 feet to the front, and every bicycle or bicycle rider must be
  6  2 equipped with a lamp exhibiting a steady or flashing red light
  6  3 visible from a distance of 300 feet to the rear.

  4 27 a bicycle on a highway. This provision of the bill does not
  4 28 apply if the bicycle is traveling on a paved shoulder or in a

  4 30    A violation of Code section 321.281 is punishable by a
  4 31 scheduled fine of $250 and a violation of Code section 321.299
  4 32 is punishable by a scheduled fine of $100. However, if a
  4 33 violation of Code section 321.299 causes a serious injury, a
  4 34 court could impose an additional fine of $500 and suspend the

  5 22 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500

  4 19 of a vehicle overtaking a person riding a bicycle proceeding
  4 20 in the same direction on a roadway to pass to the left of the

  4 22 the roadway, and prohibits the driver from returning to the
  4 23 right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken
  4 24 bicycle in accordance with Code section 321.281. Code section
  4 25 321.281 prohibits a person operating a vehicle from steering

  4 32 is punishable by a scheduled fine of $100. However, if a
  4 33 violation of Code section 321.299 causes a serious injury, a
  4 34 court could impose an additional fine of $500 and suspend the
  4 35 person's driver's license for not more than 90 days. If the

  5  7 applicable to the driver of a vehicle. The bill specifies
  5  8 that under Code section 321.304 a vehicle is prohibited from
  5  9 overtaking and passing a bicycle when approaching the crest of
  5 10 a grade or upon a curve in the highway where the driver's view
  5 11 along the highway is obstructed for a distance of approximately
  5 12 700 feet; when approaching within 100 feet of any narrow
  5 13 bridge, viaduct, or tunnel; or when approaching within 100 feet
  5 14 of or traversing any intersection or railroad grade crossing.

  5 16 where official signs are in place directing that traffic keep
  5 17 to the right or a distinctive center line or off=center line
  5 18 is marked, provided the vehicle complies with the current
  5 19 requirements for overtaking on the left.
  5 20    A violation of Code section 321.304 is punishable by a

  5 22 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  5 23 and suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  5 24 days. If the violation causes a death, a court could impose
  5 25 an additional fine of $1,000 and suspend the person's driver's
  5 26 license for not more than 180 days.
