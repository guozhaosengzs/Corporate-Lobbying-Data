  1  3    1.  The general assembly finds that a regular review of
  1  4 the programs and projects administered by state government is
  1  5 necessary to determine whether each program and project is
  1  6 effectively and efficiently meeting the needs for which created
  1  7 and whether the needs remain applicable. The general assembly
  1  8 further finds that a regular, systematic review process can
  1  9 identify the programs and projects that are no longer relevant
  1 10 or functioning at a desirable level and can eliminate or
  1 11 reorganize those programs and projects so that state resources
  1 12 can be used most effectively or diverted to other priorities.
  1 13    2.  The committees on state government of the senate
  1 14 and house of representatives shall propose legislation for
  1 15 consideration by the eighty=seventh general assembly, 2018
  1 16 session, providing a staggered schedule for establishing an
  1 17 automatic repeal date for each program or project administered
  1 18 by a department of state government over the succeeding
  1 19 five=year period. The committees on state government shall
  1 20 consult with the office of the governor and the department
  1 21 of management in formulating the staggered schedule and the
  1 22 office and department shall cooperate in providing necessary
  1 23 information requested by either committee. The repeal date
  1 24 provisions shall be implemented in a manner so that any program
  1 25 or project that is reauthorized by law is again subject to
  1 26 automatic repeal five years after reauthorization.

  1 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  1 31 administered by executive branch departments by providing for
  1 32 implementation of an organized system of ongoing repeal dates
  1 33 for the programs and projects.  Code section 8.2 defines the

  1 35 board, institution, bureau, office, or other agency of the
