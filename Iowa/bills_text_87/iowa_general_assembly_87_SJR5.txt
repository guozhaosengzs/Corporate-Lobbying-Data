  2 20 of the several states have made application for a similar

  2 28 then this state's application for a convention shall no longer

  2 30 the general assembly may withdraw this application.

  2 33 purposes of the resolution, that the application and request
  2 34 shall be null and void, and shall be rescinded and of no
  2 35 effect.

  3  2 States contained in the joint resolution would specifically
  3  3 allow Congress and the states to prohibit or regulate the
  3  4 expenditure of funds for political speech by any corporation,
