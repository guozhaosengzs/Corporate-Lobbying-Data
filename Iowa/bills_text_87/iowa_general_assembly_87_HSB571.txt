Recycling.

1.
For
the
purpose
of
this
section,
“recycling
facility”
16


means
any
facility,
business,
or
operation
that
has
the
primary
17


purpose
of
facilitating
the
recycling
of
materials
that
would
18


otherwise
be
solid
waste.

2.
Recycling
of
materials
for
the
purpose
of
being
excluded
20


from
the
solid
waste
provisions
of
chapter
455B,
division
21


IV,
part
1,
must
be
legitimate.
A
material
that
is
not
22


legitimately
recycled
is
discarded
material
and
is
a
solid
23


waste.
In
determining
if
recycling
is
legitimate,
recycling
24


facilities
must
establish
all
of
the
following:
25


a.
The
material
is
potentially
recyclable
and
has
a
feasible
26


means
of
being
recycled
into
a
valuable
product.
27


b.
The
material
is
being
managed
as
a
valuable
commodity
28


while
under
their
control.

c.
The
material
is
not
being
accumulated
speculatively
30


pursuant
to
subsection

determines
that
a
facility
is
not
32


legitimately
recycling
material,
the
department
may
allow
the

facility
owner

operator
an

The
criteria
in
subsection
2
are
intended
to
mitigate
3


the
risk
posed
by
facilities
that
accumulate
materials
4


speculatively
prior
to
recycling
by
preventing
materials
that
5


are
not
otherwise
regulated
under
chapter
455B,
division
IV,
6


part
1,
from
being
stored
indefinitely
and
potentially
causing
7


a
public
health
nuisance
or
adverse
environmental
impact.

In
response
to
enforcement
initiated
by
the
department
for
9


alleged
violations
of
this
section,
the
burden
of
proof
falls
10


on
the
recycling
facility
owner
or
operator
to
establish
that
11


materials
are
being
legitimately
recycled.

To
establish
that
a
material
is
potentially
recyclable
13


and
has
a
feasible
means
of
being
recycled
into
a
valuable
14


product,
a
recycling
facility
owner
or
operator
shall
maintain
15


with
an
end
user
at
least
one
purchase
contract,
a
letter
of
16


understanding,
or
other
formal
agreement.
Such
documentation
17


must
be
provided
to
the
department
upon
request.
In
addition,
18


if
the
material
is
going
to
be
recycled
in
an
unusual
manner,
19


the
owner
or
operator
may
use
technical
specifications
from
the
20


end
user
or
other
documentation
to
prove
recycling
the
material
21


in
such
manner
will
result
in
a
valuable
product.

To
establish
that
a
material
is
being
managed
as
a
23


valuable
commodity
while
under
their
control,
a
recycling
24


facility
owner
or
operator
shall
ensure
that
stockpiled
25


material
is
not
speculatively
accumulated
by
maintaining

current
inventory
records
and
is
managed
in
a
manner
consistent

with
comparable
recyclable
materials

in
an
equally
28


protective
manner.

To
establish
that
a
material
is
not
being
accumulated
30


speculatively,
the
recycling
facility
owner
or
operator
must
31


document
that,
during
a
given
calendar
year,
the
amount
of
32


material
that
is
recycled,
or
transferred
to
a
different
33

the
bill
requires
the
director
to
periodically
review
permits
12


and
reports
submitted
by
those
agencies
in
accordance
with
Code
13


section
455B.183(3).
14


The
current
definition
for
“recycling”
states
that
it
is
a
15


process
involving
the
collecting,
separating,
or
processing
16


of
potential
waste
to
revise
or
return
the
waste
to
use
in
17


the
form
of
raw
materials
or
products.
The
bill
changes
the
18


definition
of
“recycling”
by
stating
that
recycling
occurs
19


pursuant
to
new
Code
section
455D.4A.
The
bill
also
creates
a
20


definition
for
“recycling
facility”.
21


Currently,
the
director
may
issue
a
compliance
order
22


to
secure
compliance
or
prevent
a
violation
of
any
of
the
23


provisions
relating
to
recycling
and
waste
reduction.
A
person
24


who
violates
a
law
that
governs
the
disposal,
storage,
or
25


handling
of
certain
wastes,
or
a
rule,
permit,
or
order
issued
26


pursuant
to
one
of
those
laws,
is
subject
to
a
civil
penalty
27


of
no
more
than
$10,000.
The
department
can
request
that
the
28


attorney
general
pursue
litigation
for
that
violation.
A
29


person
found
in
violation
after
litigation
shall
be
subject
to
30


a
civil
penalty
of
up
to
$10,000
per
day.
31


The
bill
requires
a
recycling
facility
to
prove
that
32


materials
it
stores
are
potentially
recyclable.
A
person
who
33


fails
to
meet
the
criteria
for
legitimate
recycling
is
subject
34


to
