  3 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  3 23    This bill treats certain incidents of human trafficking
  3 24 as child abuse under Code chapter 232, modifies related

  3 27    To the definition of "child abuse" or "abuse", the bill
  3 28 adds "the acts or omissions of a person responsible for the
  3 29 care of a child which allow, permit, encourage, or require the
  3 30 recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining,
  3 31 patronizing, or soliciting of the child for the purpose of
  3 32 commercial sexual activity or forced labor or service" as
  3 33 defined in Code section 710A.1.
  3 34    Under Code section 710A.1, "forced labor or services" means
  3 35 labor or services that are performed or provided by another
  4  1 person and that are obtained or maintained through causing or
  4  2 threatening to cause serious physical injury to any person;
  4  3 physically restraining or threatening to physically restrain
  4  4 another person; abusing or threatening to abuse the law or
  4  5 legal process; or knowingly destroying, concealing, removing,
  4  6 confiscating, or possessing any actual or purported passport or
  4  7 other immigration document, or any other actual or purported
  4  8 government identification document, of another person.
  4  9 "Commercial sexual activity" means any sex act or sexually
  4 10 explicit performance for which anything of value is given,
  4 11 promised to, or received by any person and includes, but is not
  4 12 limited to, prostitution, participation in the production of
  4 13 pornography, and performance in strip clubs.
  4 14    The department of public health is directed, in cooperation
  4 15 with certain federal, state, and local governmental agencies
  4 16 and nongovernmental or community organizations, to identify
  4 17 and adopt existing training standards on the subject of human
  4 18 trafficking involving children that include curricula on
  4 19 recognizing human trafficking victims, culturally sensitive
  4 20 and age=appropriate methods for approaching and dealing with
  4 21 trafficking victims and affected minors, and identifying the
  4 22 appropriate authorities to whom to report potential cases of
  4 23 human trafficking. Mandatory reporter training must utilize
  4 24 these standards.
  4 25    With this change in the definition of child abuse, the
  4 26 classes of persons required or authorized to make a report of
  4 27 child abuse must also make a report of suspected forced labor
  4 28 or services and suspected commercial sexual activity involving
  4 29 a child.
  4 30    The bill makes conforming changes, including provisions
  4 31 relating to commencing child abuse assessments, referring
  4 32 reports to law enforcement, expunging data under certain
  4 33 conditions, and the procedures school districts and accredited
  4 34 nonpublic schools must use in handling child abuse reports.
  4 35    The civil and criminal sanctions of Code section 232.75
  5  1 apply to a person who fails to report a suspected case of
  5  2 child abuse or knowingly reports false information.  If the

  5  4 child abuse meets the definition of child abuse, the child
  5  5 abuse central registry provisions of Code chapters 232 and 235A
