  6 26                           EXPLANATION
  6 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 29    This bill relates to banks, credit unions, and certain
  6 30 consumer credit transactions.
  6 31    The bill modifies several provisions relating to state
  6 32 banks in Code chapter 524. The bill specifies that the
  6 33 superintendent of banking is charged with the administration,
  6 34 interpretation, and execution of the laws, rules, and
  6 35 regulations of any state or federal law or regulation relating
  7  1 to banking. The bill eliminates various provisions applicable
  7  2 to the directors and officers of state banks, including
  7  3 limitations on the receipt of loans and extensions of credit
  7  4 by such persons. However, the bill adds several references to
  7  5 federal law regulating loans to directors and officers in Code
  7  6 chapter 524.
  7  7    Current Code section 533.205(7) provides that a state credit
  7  8 union shall not pay an overdraft of a director, officer, or
  7  9 employee, unless the payment is made in accordance with an
  7 10 extension of credit plan or transfer of funds from another
  7 11 account at the state credit union. The bill modifies this
  7 12 Code section by providing that a state credit union may pay
  7 13 an overdraft of a director, officer, or employee, subject to
  7 14 the rules of the superintendent, when the payment is made in
  7 15 accordance with an extension of credit plan, transfer of funds
  7 16 from another account at the state credit union, or pursuant to
  7 17 an overdraft protection plan or courtesy pay program.
  7 18    Current Code section 537.2301 authorizes certain persons to
  7 19 make supervised loans. The bill provides that a supervised
  7 20 loan made by a person in violation of Code section 537.2301(2)
  7 21 is void and the consumer is not obligated to pay the amount
  7 22 financed or the finance charge. A consumer who has already
  7 23 paid any part of such amount or charge may recover the payment.
  7 24 With respect to violations arising from loans made pursuant
  7 25 to open=end credit, no action may be brought pursuant to the
  7 26 bill more than two years after the violation occurred. With
  7 27 respect to violations arising from other loans, no action may
  7 28 be brought pursuant to the bill more than one year after the
  7 29 due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement for
  7 30 which the charge was paid.
  7 31    Current Code section 537.2501 sets forth the charges that
  7 32 a creditor may receive in addition to a finance charge. The
  7 33 bill modifies the over=limit charge the parties to an open=end
  7 34 credit pursuant to a credit card transaction may contract for
  7 35 from up to $15 to a charge in accordance with federal law. The
  8  1 bill modifies the surcharge in Code section 537.2501(1)(g) to
  8  2 authorize a surcharge for a dishonored check, draft, or order

  7  8 union shall not pay an overdraft of a director, officer, or
  7  9 employee, unless the payment is made in accordance with an
  7 10 extension of credit plan or transfer of funds from another
  7 11 account at the state credit union. The bill modifies this

  7 13 an overdraft of a director, officer, or employee, subject to
  7 14 the rules of the superintendent, when the payment is made in
  7 15 accordance with an extension of credit plan, transfer of funds

  7 17 an overdraft protection plan or courtesy pay program.
  7 18    Current Code section 537.2301 authorizes certain persons to

  7 22 financed or the finance charge. A consumer who has already

  8  2 authorize a surcharge for a dishonored check, draft, or order
  8  3 not to exceed $30 as provided for in Code section 554.3512.

  8 10 percent of the unpaid installment or $20, to the greater of
  8 11 5 percent of the unpaid installment or $30, or the deferral
  8 12 charge amount. For an interest=bearing consumer credit
  8 13 transaction, the maximum delinquency charge is increased from 5
  8 14 percent of the unpaid installment or $15, to 5 percent of the
  8 15 unpaid installment or $30. For an open=credit arrangement, the

  8 17    Current Code section 537.2510 requires creditors to rebate
  8 18 certain amounts to consumers upon the prepayment of precomputed
  8 19 consumer credit transactions. The bill provides that Code

  8 26 available to consumers for violations of Code chapter 537. The
  8 27 bill increases the penalty a creditor must pay for contracting
  8 28 for or receiving a charge in excess of that allowed by Code
  8 29 chapter 537 from not less than $100 or more than $1,000, to not

  9  9 charges for persons required to file notification pursuant to
