 10  5 FY 2018 ANNUAL REPORTS.  Each mental health and disability
 10  6 services region's annual report due to the department of human
 10  7 services on or before December 1, 2018, pursuant to section
 10  8 331.393, subsection 3, paragraph "a", shall include a plan
 10  9 that identifies milestones for meeting intensive mental health
 10 10 service requirements described in section 331.397, subsection
 10 11 5, no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan shall, at a minimum,
 10 12 include information relating to processes, implementation time
 10 13 frames, plans for collaboration with other regions and the
 10 14 Medicaid program, and the region's associated budget plan.
 10 15    Sec. 12.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized
 10 16 by a provision of this Act, the department of human services
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
 10 19 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
 10 34 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10  7 services on or before December 1, 2018, pursuant to section
 10  8 331.393, subsection 3, paragraph "a", shall include a plan
 10  9 that identifies milestones for meeting intensive mental health
 10 10 service requirements described in section 331.397, subsection
 10 11 5, no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan shall, at a minimum,
 10 12 include information relating to processes, implementation time
 10 13 frames, plans for collaboration with other regions and the
 10 14 Medicaid program, and the region's associated budget plan.
 10 15    Sec. 12.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized
 10 16 by a provision of this Act, the department of human services
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
 10 19 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
 10 34 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and

 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as

 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and

 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with

 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental

 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because

 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the

 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental

 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under

 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,

 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,

 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall

 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10  8 331.393, subsection 3, paragraph "a", shall include a plan
 10  9 that identifies milestones for meeting intensive mental health
 10 10 service requirements described in section 331.397, subsection
 10 11 5, no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan shall, at a minimum,
 10 12 include information relating to processes, implementation time
 10 13 frames, plans for collaboration with other regions and the
 10 14 Medicaid program, and the region's associated budget plan.
 10 15    Sec. 12.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized
 10 16 by a provision of this Act, the department of human services
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
 10 19 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
 10 34 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 15    Sec. 12.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized
 10 16 by a provision of this Act, the department of human services
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,

 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as

 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and

 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because

 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual

 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the

 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.

 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the

 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,

 10 15    Sec. 12.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized
 10 16 by a provision of this Act, the department of human services
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
 10 19 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
 10 34 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 14 Medicaid program, and the region's associated budget plan.
 10 15    Sec. 12.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized
 10 16 by a provision of this Act, the department of human services
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,

 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,

 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as

 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 13 frames, plans for collaboration with other regions and the
 10 14 Medicaid program, and the region's associated budget plan.
 10 15    Sec. 12.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized
 10 16 by a provision of this Act, the department of human services
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
 10 19 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
 10 34 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.

 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control

 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the

 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided

 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting

 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 15    Sec. 12.  EMERGENCY RULES.  If specifically authorized
 10 16 by a provision of this Act, the department of human services
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
 10 19 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
 10 34 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.

 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental

 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with

 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual

 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance

 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
       LSB 5837SV (3) 87
       hb/rh
 10 17 or the mental health and disability services commission may
 10 18 adopt administrative rules under section 17A.4, subsection 3,
 10 19 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
 10 34 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional

 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental

 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because

 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the

 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures

 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive

 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 19 and section 17A.5, subsection 2, paragraph "b", to implement
 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,

 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 20 provisions of this Act and the rules shall become effective
 10 21 immediately upon filing or on a later effective date specified
 10 22 in the rules, unless the effective date of the rules is
 10 23 delayed or the applicability of the rules is suspended by the
 10 24 administrative rules review committee.  Any rules adopted in
 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before
 10 26 the rules are reviewed by the administrative rules review
 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as

 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and

 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the

 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with

 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the

 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional

 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different

 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management

 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting

 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 25 accordance with this section shall not take effect before

 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay

 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 27 committee.  The delay authority provided to the administrative
 10 28 rules review committee under section 17A.4, subsection 7, and
 10 29 section 17A.8, subsection 9, shall be applicable to a delay
 10 30 imposed under this section, notwithstanding a provision in
 10 31 those sections making them inapplicable to section 17A.5,
 10 32 subsection 2, paragraph "b".  Any rules adopted in accordance
 10 33 with the provisions of this section shall also be published as
 10 34 a notice of intended action as provided in section 17A.4.
 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt

 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical

 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with

 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental

 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 10 35                           EXPLANATION
 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11  3    This bill relates to mental health and disability services
 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under

 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11  4 and funding.
 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan

 11  5    Under current law, the department of inspections and appeals
 11  6 is required to issue a license to an applicant for a subacute
 11  7 mental health care facility if the department of inspections
 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute
 11 17 care facility beds to exceed 75 beds, and requiring that the
 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional
 11 11 conditions for licensure requiring the department of human
 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the

 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the

 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures

 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under

 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive

 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,

 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the

 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on

 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning

 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill

 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 11  8 and appeals has ascertained that the applicant's facilities and
 11  9 staff are adequate to provide the care and services required
 11 10 of a subacute care facility.  The bill strikes additional

 11 12 services to submit written approval of the application based
 11 13 upon the process used by the department of human services
 11 14 to identify the best qualified providers, prohibiting the
 11 15 department of human services from approving an application
 11 16 which would cause the number of publicly funded subacute

 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with

 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical

 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the

 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual

 11 18 subacute care facility beds identified be new beds located in
 11 19 hospitals and facilities licensed as a subacute care facility
 11 20 under Code chapter 135G.
 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting

 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.

 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community

 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability

 11 21    Under Code chapter 229 (hospitalization of persons with
 11 22 mental illness), a person may be committed for treatment
 11 23 if the person is seriously mentally impaired. A person
 11 24 is seriously mentally impaired if the person has a mental
 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,

 11 25 illness, and because of that illness lacks sufficient judgment
 11 26 to make responsible decisions with respect to the person's
 11 27 hospitalization or treatment, and because of that illness is
 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core

 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the

 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 11 28 likely to physically injure the person's self or others, is
 11 29 likely to seriously emotionally injure others, or is unable
 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the

 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different

 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the

 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11 30 to satisfy the person's basic needs.  The bill expands the
 11 31 definition of seriously mentally impaired to include a person
 11 32 who has a mental illness, because of that illness lacks
 11 33 sufficient judgment to make responsible decisions with respect
 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of

 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting

 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 11 34 to the person's hospitalization or treatment, and who because
 11 35 of that illness has a history of a lack of compliance with
 12  1 treatment and the lack of compliance has been a significant
 12  2 factor in the need for emergency hospitalization or resulted
 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code

 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 12  3 in one or more acts of serious physical injury to the person's
 12  4 self or others or an attempt to seriously physically injure the
 12  5 person's self or others.
 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,

 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management

 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.

 12  6    Under current law, if a respondent has been ordered to
 12  7 undergo outpatient treatment and fails to comply, and the
 12  8 failure to comply is likely to result in physical injury,
 12  9 a court shall order the person to be taken into physical
 12 10 custody. A respondent may choose to be treated by the
 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the

 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core

 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,

 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements

 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also

 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion

 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 12 11 appropriate medication which may include the use of injectable
 12 12 antipsychotic medicine.  The bill provides that appropriate
 12 13 medication may also include the use of oral medicine.
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,

 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.

 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes

 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the

 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's

 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,

 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive

 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided

 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code

 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.

 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

       hb/rh
 12 14    Under current law, each mental health and disability
 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 12 15 services region is required to submit an annual report to the
 12 16 department of human services on or before December 1. The
 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance

 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 12 17 annual report is required to provide information on the actual
 12 18 numbers of persons served, moneys expended, and outcomes
 12 19 achieved.  The bill provides each region shall additionally
 12 20 submit a quarterly report to the department.  Each quarterly
 12 21 report shall provide information on the accessibility of
 12 22 intensive mental health services and the progress the region
 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures
 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 12 23 has made in meeting the region's milestones for compliance
 12 24 with such service requirements using forms and procedures

 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's

 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under

 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,

 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional

 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting

 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,

 15 25 budget plan.

 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit

 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting

 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.

 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential
 13 16 service homes that serve up to 120 persons statewide.
 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 12 25 established by the department.  If a region fails to meet the
 12 26 milestones in the region's plan for compliance with such access
 12 27 requirements, the department shall require the region to submit
 12 28 a plan of correction to the department to address deficiencies
 12 29 in the region's plan.  The department shall ensure the region's
 12 30 plan of correction addresses deficiencies in the region's plan.
 12 31 The department shall combine and analyze the quarterly reports
 12 32 and make the results of the reports public within 30 days of
 12 33 receipt of all reports on a quarterly basis.
 12 34    Under current law, subject to available appropriations,
 12 35 the director of human services shall ensure that a mental
 13  1 health and disability services region's core service domains
 13  2 are covered services for the medical assistance program under
 13  3 Code chapter 249A to the greatest extent allowable under
 13  4 federal regulations.  The bill provides the medical assistance
 13  5 program shall reimburse Medicaid enrolled providers for
 13  6 Medicaid covered core services when the services are medically
 13  7 necessary, and the Medicaid enrolled provider submits an
 13  8 appropriate claim for such services. No other third=party
 13  9 payer is responsible for reimbursement of such services.
 13 10    The bill provides that the administrative rules of the state
 13 11 mental health and disability services commission relating to
 13 12 the availability of mental health and disability services
 13 13 shall, in addition to other mental health and disability
 13 14 service requirements, provide for 22 assertive community
 13 15 treatment teams, six access centers, and intensive residential

 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal

 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual

 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access

 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion

 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,

 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash

 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different

 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements

 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.

 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements

 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced

 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the

 13 17    The bill provides that, to the extent matching federal
 13 18 funding is available under the Iowa health and wellness plan,
 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also

 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable

 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds

 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the

 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to

 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also

 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion

 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.

 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the

 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other

 13 19 intensive mental health core services shall be provided in
 13 20 strategic locations throughout the state on or before July 1,
 13 21 2021, within certain core service domains including access
 13 22 centers that are located in crisis residential and subacute
 13 23 residential settings, assertive community treatment services,
 13 24 comprehensive facility and community=based crisis services,
 13 25 subacute services, and intensive residential service homes.
 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.
 15 26    The bill provides that the department of human services or
 15 27 the mental health and disability services commission may adopt
 15 28 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.

 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds

 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The

 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also

 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced

 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning

 13 26 The bill provides the department of human services shall
 13 27 accept arrangements between multiple regions sharing intensive
 13 28 mental health services when determining compliance with access
 13 29 standards for such services.
 13 30    Current Code section 331.391 establishes requirements
 13 31 related to the permissible amount of cash flow for each mental
 13 32 health and disability services region. For fiscal years
 13 33 beginning July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that
 13 34 portion of each region's cash flow amount that exceeds 25
 13 35 percent of the gross expenditures from the region's combined
 14  1 account or from all separate county accounts under the control
 14  2 of the governing board in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal
 14  3 year in progress are required to be used in whole or in part
 14  4 to fund the payment of mental health and disabilities services
 14  5 provided under the regional service system management plan.
 14  6 Current law also imposes similar requirements for the amount of
 14  7 unobligated and unencumbered funds that are reserved in each
 14  8 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations
 14  9 in the next fiscal year, imposes annual reporting requirements
 14 10 for region and county cash flow amounts, and imposes, for
 14 11 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021, either a 20
 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning
 14 24 July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019, that the portion
 14 25 of each county's or region's cash flow amount that exceeds
 14 26 the 25 percent limitation be used in whole or in part to fund
 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The
 14 29 bill also strikes the reporting requirements for counties and
 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
 14 35 the fiscal year in progress for the combined account of the
 15  1 region or for all regional accounts and requires residual
 15  2 funding remaining in excess of such limitation to be used to
 15  3 expand the region's core services and then make additional core
 15  4 services available.  The bill also provides that an amount of
 15  5 unobligated or unencumbered funds, as specified in the regional
 15  6 governance agreement, is required to be reserved in each
 15  7 county's county services fund to address cash flow obligations.
 15  8    Under the bill, if a county officially joins a different
 15  9 mental health and disability services region, that county's
 15 10 budgeted amount shall be the amount necessary to meet the
 15 11 county's financial obligations for payment of services provided
 15 12 under the new region's regional service system management
 15 13 plan, not to exceed an amount equal to the product of the
 15 14 new region's regional per capita expenditure target amount
 15 15 multiplied by the county's population.
 15 16    The bill provides that each mental health and disability
 15 17 services region, in the region's annual report due to the
 15 18 department of human services on or before December 1, 2018,
 15 19 shall include a plan that identifies milestones for meeting
 15 20 intensive mental health service requirements described in Code
 15 21 section 331.397(5), no later than July 1, 2021.  The plan
 15 22 shall, at a minimum, include information relating to processes,
 15 23 implementation time frames, plans for collaboration with other
 15 24 regions and the Medicaid program, and the region's associated
 15 25 budget plan.

 14 12 or 25 percent limitation on each county or region's cash flow
 14 13 amount based on the region's population. Current law also
 14 14 requires that for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1,
 14 15 2021, of a county's cash flow amount maintained in the county
 14 16 services fund or of the region's cash flow amount attributable
 14 17 to the county, the county budgeted amount, used to limit the
 14 18 amount of property taxes levied by the county, is reduced
 14 19 by the county's cash flow reduction amount.  The cash flow
 14 20 reduction amount is equal to the amount of the county's cash
 14 21 flow in excess of the permissible percentage limits based on
 14 22 population of the region.
 14 23    The bill strikes the requirement for fiscal years beginning

 14 27 the payment of mental health and disability services provided
 14 28 under a region's regional service system management plan.  The

 14 30 regions and eliminates the reduction in a county's budgeted
 14 31 amount due to the county's cash flow reduction amount for
 14 32 fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2021.  The bill
 14 33 establishes a limitation on the cash flow amount of a region
 14 34 equal to 30 percent of the gross expenditures budgeted for
