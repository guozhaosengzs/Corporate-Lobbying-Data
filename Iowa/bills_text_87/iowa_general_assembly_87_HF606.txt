 17 20                           EXPLANATION
 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    BACKGROUND.  Iowa law currently imposes a state sales tax and
 17 24 a state use tax.  The state sales tax applies to retail sales of
 17 25 property and certain services within Iowa.  The state use tax
 17 26 is complementary to the state sales tax and generally applies
 17 27 to the purchase of property or a service that would be subject
 17 28 to the state sales tax if the transaction was consummated in
 17 29 Iowa, but that is instead consummated outside of Iowa but
 17 30 purchased for use in Iowa and used in Iowa.
 17 31    Iowa law also currently allows Iowa counties to impose a
 17 32 local sales and services tax that, with a few exceptions,
 17 33 applies to the same sales of property and services as are
 17 34 subject to the state sales tax.  The local option sales and
 17 35 services tax generally applies to sales occurring, and services
 18  1 performed, within the area imposing the tax.  Iowa law does not
 18  2 permit counties to impose a local use tax.
 18  3    BILL CHANGES.  This bill creates a local option use tax that
 18  4 may be imposed by a county that is also imposing a local option
 18  5 sales and services tax.  If imposed, the local use tax rate
 18  6 must be the same as the county's local sales and services tax
 18  7 rate, which under current law cannot exceed 1 percent.
 18  8    The local option use tax is authorized, imposed, and
 18  9 repealed by a county in the same manner as a local option
 18 10 sales and services tax and is administered by the department
 18 11 of revenue (department) in the same manner as the state sales
 18 12 and use tax laws.  A county may impose the local option use
 18 13 tax upon a petition of the voters or motions of city councils
 18 14 or the board of supervisors and after an election at which a
 18 15 majority of those voting favors imposition.  When imposed, a
 18 16 local option use tax only applies in those incorporated areas
 18 17 and the unincorporated area of a county in which a majority of
 18 18 those voting in the area favored imposition, and if the area
 18 19 is also imposing the local sales and services tax.  The local
 18 20 option use tax may be repealed by a majority vote or by motion
 18 21 of the governing body of the area imposing the tax.  However,
 18 22 if the county's local option sales and services tax is repealed
 18 23 or the rate decreased, the bill provides that the local option
 18 24 use tax imposed in that county, if any, shall be deemed to
 18 25 be repealed or reduced by the same election or motion of the
 18 26 governing body.
 18 27    The local option use tax is imposed on the same basis as the
 18 28 state use tax and is applicable to uses of taxable property
 18 29 or services within those incorporated and unincorporated
 18 30 areas of the county where it is imposed.  The bill provides
 18 31 that evidence that tangible personal property was sold by any
 18 32 person for delivery to a location in Iowa shall be prima facie
 18 33 evidence that such tangible personal property was sold for use
 18 34 at that location in Iowa.  The bill also provides that the
 18 35 local option use tax will not apply to the use of natural gas,
 19  1 natural gas service, electricity, or electric service, certain
 19  2 uses of motor or special fuel, the use of equipment by the
 19  3 state department of transportation, and the use of any property
 19  4 or service not taxed by the state.
 19  5    The local option use tax is required to be collected by
 19  6 persons required to collect state use taxes, and if not
 19  7 collected by such persons is required to be paid by the person
 19  8 using the property or service.
 19  9    Local option use taxes are remitted to the department of
 19 10 revenue to be deposited in the appropriate county's account
 19 11 within the local use tax fund created in the bill, and are then
 19 12 distributed back to local governments according to a statutory
 19 13 formula involving population and property tax revenues in the
 19 14 same manner as local sales and services tax revenues are under
 19 15 current law.  Local option use taxes received by a city or
 19 16 county may be expended for any lawful purposes of the city or
 19 17 county.
 19 18    The bill provides that local option use taxes may be refunded
 19 19 to certain construction contractors, and pledged towards the
 19 20 repayment of bonds of a city or county, in the same manner as
 19 21 local option sales and services taxes may be under current law.
 19 22 The bill does not allow local use tax revenues to be used to
 19 23 fund urban renewal projects, which is a permitted use of local
 19 24 sales and services tax revenues under current law.
 19 25    Finally, the bill makes several corresponding changes
 19 26 to provisions of the Iowa Code that reference local option
 19 27 taxes or the local option sales and services tax to include
 19 28 references to the local option use tax created in the bill.

 18 10 sales and services tax and is administered by the department
 18 11 of revenue (department) in the same manner as the state sales
 18 12 and use tax laws.  A county may impose the local option use
 18 13 tax upon a petition of the voters or motions of city councils
 18 14 or the board of supervisors and after an election at which a
 18 15 majority of those voting favors imposition.  When imposed, a
 18 16 local option use tax only applies in those incorporated areas
 18 17 and the unincorporated area of a county in which a majority of
 18 18 those voting in the area favored imposition, and if the area
 18 19 is also imposing the local sales and services tax.  The local
 18 20 option use tax may be repealed by a majority vote or by motion
 18 21 of the governing body of the area imposing the tax.  However,
 18 22 if the county's local option sales and services tax is repealed
 18 23 or the rate decreased, the bill provides that the local option
 18 24 use tax imposed in that county, if any, shall be deemed to
 18 25 be repealed or reduced by the same election or motion of the
 18 26 governing body.
 18 27    The local option use tax is imposed on the same basis as the
 18 28 state use tax and is applicable to uses of taxable property
 18 29 or services within those incorporated and unincorporated
 18 30 areas of the county where it is imposed.  The bill provides
 18 31 that evidence that tangible personal property was sold by any
 18 32 person for delivery to a location in Iowa shall be prima facie
 18 33 evidence that such tangible personal property was sold for use
 18 34 at that location in Iowa.  The bill also provides that the
 18 35 local option use tax will not apply to the use of natural gas,
 19  1 natural gas service, electricity, or electric service, certain
 19  2 uses of motor or special fuel, the use of equipment by the
 19  3 state department of transportation, and the use of any property
 19  4 or service not taxed by the state.
 19  5    The local option use tax is required to be collected by
 19  6 persons required to collect state use taxes, and if not
 19  7 collected by such persons is required to be paid by the person
 19  8 using the property or service.
 19  9    Local option use taxes are remitted to the department of
 19 10 revenue to be deposited in the appropriate county's account
 19 11 within the local use tax fund created in the bill, and are then
 19 12 distributed back to local governments according to a statutory
 19 13 formula involving population and property tax revenues in the
 19 14 same manner as local sales and services tax revenues are under

 19 18    The bill provides that local option use taxes may be refunded

 18 32 person for delivery to a location in Iowa shall be prima facie
 18 33 evidence that such tangible personal property was sold for use
 18 34 at that location in Iowa.  The bill also provides that the
 18 35 local option use tax will not apply to the use of natural gas,
 19  1 natural gas service, electricity, or electric service, certain
 19  2 uses of motor or special fuel, the use of equipment by the
 19  3 state department of transportation, and the use of any property
 19  4 or service not taxed by the state.
 19  5    The local option use tax is required to be collected by
 19  6 persons required to collect state use taxes, and if not
 19  7 collected by such persons is required to be paid by the person
 19  8 using the property or service.
 19  9    Local option use taxes are remitted to the department of
 19 10 revenue to be deposited in the appropriate county's account
 19 11 within the local use tax fund created in the bill, and are then
 19 12 distributed back to local governments according to a statutory
 19 13 formula involving population and property tax revenues in the
 19 14 same manner as local sales and services tax revenues are under
 19 15 current law.  Local option use taxes received by a city or
 19 16 county may be expended for any lawful purposes of the city or
 19 17 county.
 19 18    The bill provides that local option use taxes may be refunded
 19 19 to certain construction contractors, and pledged towards the
 19 20 repayment of bonds of a city or county, in the same manner as
 19 21 local option sales and services taxes may be under current law.
 19 22 The bill does not allow local use tax revenues to be used to
 19 23 fund urban renewal projects, which is a permitted use of local
 19 24 sales and services tax revenues under current law.

 17 20                           EXPLANATION
 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    BACKGROUND.  Iowa law currently imposes a state sales tax and
 17 24 a state use tax.  The state sales tax applies to retail sales of
 17 25 property and certain services within Iowa.  The state use tax
 17 26 is complementary to the state sales tax and generally applies
 17 27 to the purchase of property or a service that would be subject
 17 28 to the state sales tax if the transaction was consummated in
 17 29 Iowa, but that is instead consummated outside of Iowa but
 17 30 purchased for use in Iowa and used in Iowa.
 17 31    Iowa law also currently allows Iowa counties to impose a
 17 32 local sales and services tax that, with a few exceptions,
 17 33 applies to the same sales of property and services as are
 17 34 subject to the state sales tax.  The local option sales and
 17 35 services tax generally applies to sales occurring, and services
 18  1 performed, within the area imposing the tax.  Iowa law does not
 18  2 permit counties to impose a local use tax.
 18  3    BILL CHANGES.  This bill creates a local option use tax that
 18  4 may be imposed by a county that is also imposing a local option
 18  5 sales and services tax.  If imposed, the local use tax rate
 18  6 must be the same as the county's local sales and services tax
 18  7 rate, which under current law cannot exceed 1 percent.
 18  8    The local option use tax is authorized, imposed, and
 18  9 repealed by a county in the same manner as a local option
 18 10 sales and services tax and is administered by the department
 18 11 of revenue (department) in the same manner as the state sales
 18 12 and use tax laws.  A county may impose the local option use
 18 13 tax upon a petition of the voters or motions of city councils
 18 14 or the board of supervisors and after an election at which a
 18 15 majority of those voting favors imposition.  When imposed, a
 18 16 local option use tax only applies in those incorporated areas
 18 17 and the unincorporated area of a county in which a majority of
 18 18 those voting in the area favored imposition, and if the area
 18 19 is also imposing the local sales and services tax.  The local
 18 20 option use tax may be repealed by a majority vote or by motion
 18 21 of the governing body of the area imposing the tax.  However,
 18 22 if the county's local option sales and services tax is repealed
 18 23 or the rate decreased, the bill provides that the local option
 18 24 use tax imposed in that county, if any, shall be deemed to
 18 25 be repealed or reduced by the same election or motion of the
 18 26 governing body.
 18 27    The local option use tax is imposed on the same basis as the
 18 28 state use tax and is applicable to uses of taxable property
 18 29 or services within those incorporated and unincorporated
 18 30 areas of the county where it is imposed.  The bill provides
 18 31 that evidence that tangible personal property was sold by any
 18 32 person for delivery to a location in Iowa shall be prima facie
 18 33 evidence that such tangible personal property was sold for use
 18 34 at that location in Iowa.  The bill also provides that the
 18 35 local option use tax will not apply to the use of natural gas,
 19  1 natural gas service, electricity, or electric service, certain
 19  2 uses of motor or special fuel, the use of equipment by the
 19  3 state department of transportation, and the use of any property
 19  4 or service not taxed by the state.
 19  5    The local option use tax is required to be collected by
 19  6 persons required to collect state use taxes, and if not
 19  7 collected by such persons is required to be paid by the person
 19  8 using the property or service.
 19  9    Local option use taxes are remitted to the department of
 19 10 revenue to be deposited in the appropriate county's account
 19 11 within the local use tax fund created in the bill, and are then
 19 12 distributed back to local governments according to a statutory
 19 13 formula involving population and property tax revenues in the
 19 14 same manner as local sales and services tax revenues are under
 19 15 current law.  Local option use taxes received by a city or
 19 16 county may be expended for any lawful purposes of the city or
 19 17 county.
 19 18    The bill provides that local option use taxes may be refunded
 19 19 to certain construction contractors, and pledged towards the
 19 20 repayment of bonds of a city or county, in the same manner as
 19 21 local option sales and services taxes may be under current law.
 19 22 The bill does not allow local use tax revenues to be used to
 19 23 fund urban renewal projects, which is a permitted use of local
 19 24 sales and services tax revenues under current law.

 19 26 to provisions of the Iowa Code that reference local option
 19 27 taxes or the local option sales and services tax to include
 19 28 references to the local option use tax created in the bill.

 17 26 is complementary to the state sales tax and generally applies

 17 29 Iowa, but that is instead consummated outside of Iowa but
 17 30 purchased for use in Iowa and used in Iowa.
 17 31    Iowa law also currently allows Iowa counties to impose a

 18 13 tax upon a petition of the voters or motions of city councils
 18 14 or the board of supervisors and after an election at which a
 18 15 majority of those voting favors imposition.  When imposed, a
 18 16 local option use tax only applies in those incorporated areas
 18 17 and the unincorporated area of a county in which a majority of
 18 18 those voting in the area favored imposition, and if the area
 18 19 is also imposing the local sales and services tax.  The local
 18 20 option use tax may be repealed by a majority vote or by motion
 18 21 of the governing body of the area imposing the tax.  However,
 18 22 if the county's local option sales and services tax is repealed
 18 23 or the rate decreased, the bill provides that the local option
 18 24 use tax imposed in that county, if any, shall be deemed to
 18 25 be repealed or reduced by the same election or motion of the
 18 26 governing body.
 18 27    The local option use tax is imposed on the same basis as the
 18 28 state use tax and is applicable to uses of taxable property
 18 29 or services within those incorporated and unincorporated
 18 30 areas of the county where it is imposed.  The bill provides
 18 31 that evidence that tangible personal property was sold by any
 18 32 person for delivery to a location in Iowa shall be prima facie
 18 33 evidence that such tangible personal property was sold for use
 18 34 at that location in Iowa.  The bill also provides that the
 18 35 local option use tax will not apply to the use of natural gas,
 19  1 natural gas service, electricity, or electric service, certain
 19  2 uses of motor or special fuel, the use of equipment by the
 19  3 state department of transportation, and the use of any property
 19  4 or service not taxed by the state.
 19  5    The local option use tax is required to be collected by
 19  6 persons required to collect state use taxes, and if not
 19  7 collected by such persons is required to be paid by the person
 19  8 using the property or service.
 19  9    Local option use taxes are remitted to the department of
 19 10 revenue to be deposited in the appropriate county's account
 19 11 within the local use tax fund created in the bill, and are then

 19 19 to certain construction contractors, and pledged towards the
