  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable

  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide

  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other

  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the

  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall

  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility

  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The

  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the

  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the
  6 18 treatment of a person with a serious and persistent mental
  6 19 illness that requires inpatient care on a long=term basis if
  6 20 the person is in court=ordered outpatient treatment and certain
  6 21 circumstances apply.
  6 22    The department of human services, in coordination with
  6 23 regional administrators of county mental health and disability
  6 24 services regions, the state mental health and disability
  6 25 services commission, service providers, and other stakeholders,
  6 26 is required to develop a methodology to establish appropriate
  6 27 medical assistance program reimbursement rates for the actual
  6 28 cost of mental health treatment services and associated room
  6 29 and board costs in a subacute care facility licensed under
  6 30 Code chapter 135G for eligible persons under the bill.  The
  6 31 department is required to adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the
  6 18 treatment of a person with a serious and persistent mental
  6 19 illness that requires inpatient care on a long=term basis if
  6 20 the person is in court=ordered outpatient treatment and certain
  6 21 circumstances apply.
  6 22    The department of human services, in coordination with
  6 23 regional administrators of county mental health and disability
  6 24 services regions, the state mental health and disability
  6 25 services commission, service providers, and other stakeholders,
  6 26 is required to develop a methodology to establish appropriate
  6 27 medical assistance program reimbursement rates for the actual
  6 28 cost of mental health treatment services and associated room
  6 29 and board costs in a subacute care facility licensed under
  6 30 Code chapter 135G for eligible persons under the bill.  The
  6 31 department is required to adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A
  6 32 to administer the provisions of the bill.

  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an

  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The

  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the

  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the
  6 18 treatment of a person with a serious and persistent mental
  6 19 illness that requires inpatient care on a long=term basis if
  6 20 the person is in court=ordered outpatient treatment and certain
  6 21 circumstances apply.
  6 22    The department of human services, in coordination with

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the
  6 18 treatment of a person with a serious and persistent mental
  6 19 illness that requires inpatient care on a long=term basis if
  6 20 the person is in court=ordered outpatient treatment and certain
  6 21 circumstances apply.

  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the

  3 33    1.  The department of human services, in coordination with
  3 34 regional administrators of county mental health and disability
  3 35 services regions, the state mental health and disability
  4  1 services commission, service providers, and other stakeholders,
  4  2 shall develop a methodology to establish appropriate medical
  4  3 assistance program reimbursement rates for the actual cost
  4  4 of mental health treatment services and associated room and
  4  5 board costs in a subacute mental health facility licensed under
  4  6 chapter 135G for eligible persons pursuant to this Act.
  4  7    2.  The department of human services shall adopt rules

  4  9 Act.
  4 10    Sec. 6.  CITATION.  This Act may, along with its formal
  4 11 citation, be cited as "Jackie's Law".
  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the
  6 18 treatment of a person with a serious and persistent mental
  6 19 illness that requires inpatient care on a long=term basis if
  6 20 the person is in court=ordered outpatient treatment and certain
  6 21 circumstances apply.
  6 22    The department of human services, in coordination with
  6 23 regional administrators of county mental health and disability
  6 24 services regions, the state mental health and disability
  6 25 services commission, service providers, and other stakeholders,
  6 26 is required to develop a methodology to establish appropriate
  6 27 medical assistance program reimbursement rates for the actual
  6 28 cost of mental health treatment services and associated room
  6 29 and board costs in a subacute care facility licensed under
  6 30 Code chapter 135G for eligible persons under the bill.  The
  6 31 department is required to adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A
  6 32 to administer the provisions of the bill.

  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be

  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send

  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during

  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the
  6 18 treatment of a person with a serious and persistent mental
  6 19 illness that requires inpatient care on a long=term basis if
  6 20 the person is in court=ordered outpatient treatment and certain
  6 21 circumstances apply.

  6 23 regional administrators of county mental health and disability
  6 24 services regions, the state mental health and disability

  6 26 is required to develop a methodology to establish appropriate
  6 27 medical assistance program reimbursement rates for the actual
  6 28 cost of mental health treatment services and associated room

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the

  4 12                           EXPLANATION
  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the
  6 18 treatment of a person with a serious and persistent mental
  6 19 illness that requires inpatient care on a long=term basis if
  6 20 the person is in court=ordered outpatient treatment and certain
  6 21 circumstances apply.
  6 22    The department of human services, in coordination with
  6 23 regional administrators of county mental health and disability
  6 24 services regions, the state mental health and disability
  6 25 services commission, service providers, and other stakeholders,
  6 26 is required to develop a methodology to establish appropriate
  6 27 medical assistance program reimbursement rates for the actual
  6 28 cost of mental health treatment services and associated room
  6 29 and board costs in a subacute care facility licensed under
  6 30 Code chapter 135G for eligible persons under the bill.  The
  6 31 department is required to adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A
  6 32 to administer the provisions of the bill.

  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility

  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day

  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals

  4 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 15    This bill relates to the provision and financing of
  4 16 long=term care services in subacute care mental health care
  4 17 facilities for persons with serious and persistent mental
  4 18 illness.
  4 19    The bill amends Code section 229.13 relating to a person
  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide
  5 30 such notice to the outpatient treatment facility at which
  5 31 the respondent was previously ordered to undergo outpatient
  5 32 treatment.  If charges are pending against the respondent, the
  5 33 respondent may be detained in protective custody in a hospital
  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.
  6  2    The bill allows a family member of the respondent to provide
  6  3 information to the mental health professional or any of the
  6  4 respondent's outpatient treatment providers from which the
  6  5 mental health professional or outpatient treatment provider
  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
  6  7 likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's self
  6  8 or others. The bill then provides that the court may order the
  6  9 respondent treated on an inpatient basis in a suitable facility
  6 10 in addition to a hospital.  The bill defines other suitable
  6 11 facility to include an appropriate subacute care facility
  6 12 licensed under Code chapter 135G but excludes a jail or other
  6 13 correctional facility.
  6 14    The bill requires the department of inspections and appeals
  6 15 to adopt rules relating to eligibility requirements for
  6 16 individualized subacute mental health services in subacute care
  6 17 facilities licensed under Code chapter 135G to allow for the
  6 18 treatment of a person with a serious and persistent mental
  6 19 illness that requires inpatient care on a long=term basis if
  6 20 the person is in court=ordered outpatient treatment and certain
  6 21 circumstances apply.
  6 22    The department of human services, in coordination with
  6 23 regional administrators of county mental health and disability
  6 24 services regions, the state mental health and disability
  6 25 services commission, service providers, and other stakeholders,
  6 26 is required to develop a methodology to establish appropriate
  6 27 medical assistance program reimbursement rates for the actual
  6 28 cost of mental health treatment services and associated room
  6 29 and board costs in a subacute care facility licensed under
  6 30 Code chapter 135G for eligible persons under the bill.  The
  6 31 department is required to adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A
  6 32 to administer the provisions of the bill.

  4 20 (respondent) who is under a court order to undergo outpatient
  4 21 treatment for mental illness upon the conclusion of an
  4 22 involuntary hospitalization proceeding.  Under current law,
  4 23 if the respondent is ordered to undergo outpatient treatment
  4 24 and the respondent's failure to comply with the course of
  4 25 treatment results in behavior by the respondent which, in
  4 26 the opinion of the respondent's mental health professional,
  4 27 is likely to result in physical injury to the respondent's
  4 28 self or others if allowed to continue, the respondent may be
  4 29 taken into protective custody. Once in protective custody,
  4 30 the respondent shall be given the choice of being treated
  4 31 by the appropriate medication at an outpatient psychiatric
  4 32 clinic, hospital, or other suitable facility or being placed
  4 33 for treatment under the care of a hospital or other suitable
  4 34 facility for inpatient treatment.  If the respondent chooses to
  4 35 be treated by the appropriate medication but the mental health
  5  1 professional at the outpatient psychiatric clinic, hospital,
  5  2 or other suitable facility determines that the respondent's
  5  3 behavior continues to be likely to result in physical injury
  5  4 to the respondent's self or others if allowed to continue, the
  5  5 mental health professional is required to notify the committing
  5  6 court, and after proper notice and hearing, the court may
  5  7 order the respondent treated on an inpatient basis requiring
  5  8 full=time custody, care, and treatment in a hospital until it
  5  9 is determined that the respondent does not require further
  5 10 treatment for serious mental impairment or has indicated
  5 11 the respondent is willing to submit to other court=ordered
  5 12 treatment.
  5 13    The bill provides that the court's written order shall
  5 14 include a statement that the respondent has not been compliant
  5 15 with the committing court's outpatient treatment order.  The
  5 16 clerk of the district court shall enter notice of the court's
  5 17 order into the Iowa criminal justice information system or
  5 18 the national crime information center system, and shall send
  5 19 a copy of the order to the outpatient treatment facility
  5 20 at which the respondent was previously ordered to undergo
  5 21 outpatient treatment.  If the respondent's mental health
  5 22 professional is unable to contact the committing court during
  5 23 regular business hours, the mental health professional shall
  5 24 notify the appropriate sheriff or sheriff's deputy who shall
  5 25 take the respondent into immediate protective custody.  The
  5 26 respondent's mental health professional shall provide notice of
  5 27 such action to the committing court on the next business day
  5 28 and the committing court shall proceed as provided in the bill.
  5 29 The respondent's mental health professional shall also provide

  5 34 or other suitable facility for a 72=hour period for crisis
  5 35 observation and treatment before formal charges can be filed
  6  1 against the respondent.

  6  6 may conclude that the respondent's behavior continues to be
