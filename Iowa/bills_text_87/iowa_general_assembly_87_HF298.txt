  2 22 such medical examinations and tests the physician considers
  2 23 necessary in making a reasonable medical judgment to accurately
  2 24 determine the postfertilization age of the human pregnancy.
  2 25    2.  a.  A physician shall not perform or induce or attempt

  2 32 applies:
  2 33    (1)  The pregnant woman has a condition which the physician
  2 34 deems a medical emergency.

  3  3 subsection, the physician shall terminate the human pregnancy
  3  4 in the manner which, in the physician's reasonable medical
  3  5 judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child
  3  6 to survive, unless, in the physician's reasonable medical
  3  7 judgment, termination of the human pregnancy in that manner
  3  8 would pose a greater risk than any other available method of
  3  9 the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and
  3 10 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
  3 11 A greater risk shall not be deemed to exist if it is based on
  3 12 a claim or diagnosis that the pregnant woman will engage in
  3 13 conduct which would result in the pregnant woman's death or in
  3 14 substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
  3 15 bodily function.

  3 30 an abortion performed when the probable postfertilization age
  3 31 was determined to be twenty or more weeks, whether the method
  3 32 of abortion used was one that, in the physician's reasonable
  3 33 medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for the unborn
  3 34 child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
  3 35 of the determination that termination of the human pregnancy
  4  1 in that manner would pose a greater risk than would any other

  4  3 substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
  4  4 bodily function.

  4 20 subsection 3 who has not submitted a report or who has
  4 21 submitted only an incomplete report more than one year
  4 22 following the due date, may, in an action brought in the

  4 24 be directed by a court of competent jurisdiction to submit a
  4 25 complete report within a time period stated by court order or
  4 26 be subject to contempt of court.
  4 27    (3)  A physician who intentionally or recklessly falsifies
  4 28 a report required under this section is subject to a civil
  4 29 penalty of one hundred dollars.

  3  8 would pose a greater risk than any other available method of
  3  9 the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and
  3 10 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
  3 11 A greater risk shall not be deemed to exist if it is based on

  3 29    d.  The method used for the abortion and, in the case of
  3 30 an abortion performed when the probable postfertilization age

  3 32 of abortion used was one that, in the physician's reasonable
  3 33 medical judgment, provided the best opportunity for the unborn
  3 34 child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
  3 35 of the determination that termination of the human pregnancy
  4  1 in that manner would pose a greater risk than would any other
  4  2 available method of the death of the pregnant woman or of the

  3 34 child to survive or, if such a method was not used, the basis
  3 35 of the determination that termination of the human pregnancy
  4  1 in that manner would pose a greater risk than would any other
  4  2 available method of the death of the pregnant woman or of the

  7 16                           EXPLANATION
  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to abortions. The bill provides that,
  7 20 except in the case of a medical emergency, an abortion shall
  7 21 not be performed or induced or be attempted to be performed
  7 22 or induced unless the physician performing or inducing the
  7 23 abortion has first made a determination of the probable
  7 24 postfertilization age of the human pregnancy. Additionally,
  7 25 the bill prohibits a physician from performing or inducing
  7 26 or attempting to perform or induce an abortion upon a
  7 27 pregnant woman when it has been determined, that the probable
  7 28 postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks unless, in the
  7 29 physician's reasonable medical judgment, either the pregnant
  7 30 woman has a condition which the physician deems a medical
  7 31 emergency or it is necessary to preserve the life of the
  7 32 unborn child. If an abortion is performed or induced when
  7 33 the probable postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks, the
  7 34 physician is required to terminate the pregnancy in a manner
  7 35 which, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, provides
  8  1 the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless
  8  2 such termination would pose a greater risk either of the death
  8  3 of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible
  8  4 physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman
  8  5 than would another available method.
  8  6    The bill also requires certain reports to be filed by a
  8  7 physician who performs or induces or attempts to perform or
  8  8 induce an abortion with the department of public health, on
  8  9 a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules adopted by
  8 10 the department. The department is required to compile the
  8 11 information collected annually and issue a public report,
  8 12 ensuring that none of the information included in the public
  8 13 reports could reasonably lead to the identification of any
  8 14 pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed. The bill
  8 15 provides monetary penalties for a physician who fails to submit
  8 16 a report in a timely manner, submits an incomplete report, or
  8 17 intentionally or recklessly falsifies a required report.
  8 18    The bill provides for civil and criminal actions and
  8 19 penalties relating to violations of the bill. Failure of a
  8 20 physician to comply with any provision, with the exception of
  8 21 the late filing of a report or failure to submit a complete
  8 22 report in compliance with a court order, is grounds for license
  8 23 discipline. A physician who intentionally or recklessly
  8 24 performs or attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the
  8 25 bill is guilty of a class "C" felony, which is punishable by
  8 26 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  8 27 $1,000 but not more than $10,000. The bill also provides that
  8 28 a medical facility licensed in the state in which abortions
  8 29 are performed or induced in violation of the bill is subject
  8 30 to immediate revocation of licensure. Additionally, a
  8 31 medical facility licensed in this state in which abortions are
  8 32 performed or induced in violation of the bill is ineligible to
  8 33 receive state funding and is subject to repayment of any state
  8 34 funds received from the state during the time after which an
  8 35 abortion in violation of the bill was performed or induced.
  9  1 However, the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or was
  9  2 attempted to be performed is not subject to prosecution for a
  9  3 violation of the bill. The bill provides for the maintaining
  9  4 of actions by certain people based on alleged violations of
  9  5 the bill. A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in
  9  6 violation of the bill or the biological father may maintain
  9  7 an action against the physician who performed the abortion
  9  8 in intentional or reckless violation of the bill for actual
  9  9 damages. A woman upon whom an abortion has been attempted
  9 10 in violation of the bill may maintain an action against the
  9 11 physician who attempted to perform the abortion in intentional
  9 12 or reckless violation of the bill for actual damages.
  9 13 Additionally, a cause of action for injunctive relief to
  9 14 prevent a physician from performing abortions may be maintained
  9 15 against a physician who has intentionally violated the bill by
  9 16 the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or attempted
  9 17 to be performed, by the spouse of the woman, by a parent or
  9 18 guardian of the woman if the woman is less than 18 years of
  9 19 age or unmarried at the time the abortion was performed or
  9 20 attempted to be performed, by a current or former licensed
  9 21 health care provider of the woman, by a county attorney with
  9 22 appropriate jurisdiction, or by the attorney general.
  9 23    The bill provides a process for preserving the anonymity of
  9 24 the woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted
  9 25 from public disclosure if the woman does not provide consent to
  9 26 such disclosure during any proceeding or action under the bill.
  9 27    The bill also provides that the bill is not to be construed
  9 28 as creating or recognizing a right to an abortion, and the
  9 29 bill is not to be construed as determining life to begin at 20
  9 30 weeks' gestation; instead, it is recognized that life begins
  9 31 at conception.
  9 32    The bill includes a severability clause as is applicable to
  9 33 every Act or statute pursuant to Code section 4.12.

  7 34 physician is required to terminate the pregnancy in a manner
  7 35 which, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, provides
  8  1 the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless
  8  2 such termination would pose a greater risk either of the death
  8  3 of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible
  8  4 physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman
  8  5 than would another available method.
  8  6    The bill also requires certain reports to be filed by a
  8  7 physician who performs or induces or attempts to perform or
  8  8 induce an abortion with the department of public health, on
  8  9 a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules adopted by
  8 10 the department. The department is required to compile the
  8 11 information collected annually and issue a public report,
  8 12 ensuring that none of the information included in the public
  8 13 reports could reasonably lead to the identification of any
  8 14 pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed. The bill
  8 15 provides monetary penalties for a physician who fails to submit
  8 16 a report in a timely manner, submits an incomplete report, or
  8 17 intentionally or recklessly falsifies a required report.
  8 18    The bill provides for civil and criminal actions and
  8 19 penalties relating to violations of the bill. Failure of a
  8 20 physician to comply with any provision, with the exception of
  8 21 the late filing of a report or failure to submit a complete
  8 22 report in compliance with a court order, is grounds for license
  8 23 discipline. A physician who intentionally or recklessly
  8 24 performs or attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the
  8 25 bill is guilty of a class "C" felony, which is punishable by
  8 26 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  8 27 $1,000 but not more than $10,000. The bill also provides that
  8 28 a medical facility licensed in the state in which abortions
  8 29 are performed or induced in violation of the bill is subject
  8 30 to immediate revocation of licensure. Additionally, a
  8 31 medical facility licensed in this state in which abortions are
  8 32 performed or induced in violation of the bill is ineligible to
  8 33 receive state funding and is subject to repayment of any state
  8 34 funds received from the state during the time after which an
  8 35 abortion in violation of the bill was performed or induced.
  9  1 However, the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or was
  9  2 attempted to be performed is not subject to prosecution for a
  9  3 violation of the bill. The bill provides for the maintaining
  9  4 of actions by certain people based on alleged violations of
  9  5 the bill. A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in
  9  6 violation of the bill or the biological father may maintain
  9  7 an action against the physician who performed the abortion
  9  8 in intentional or reckless violation of the bill for actual
  9  9 damages. A woman upon whom an abortion has been attempted
  9 10 in violation of the bill may maintain an action against the
  9 11 physician who attempted to perform the abortion in intentional
  9 12 or reckless violation of the bill for actual damages.
  9 13 Additionally, a cause of action for injunctive relief to
  9 14 prevent a physician from performing abortions may be maintained
  9 15 against a physician who has intentionally violated the bill by
  9 16 the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or attempted
  9 17 to be performed, by the spouse of the woman, by a parent or
  9 18 guardian of the woman if the woman is less than 18 years of
  9 19 age or unmarried at the time the abortion was performed or
  9 20 attempted to be performed, by a current or former licensed
  9 21 health care provider of the woman, by a county attorney with
  9 22 appropriate jurisdiction, or by the attorney general.
  9 23    The bill provides a process for preserving the anonymity of
  9 24 the woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted
  9 25 from public disclosure if the woman does not provide consent to
  9 26 such disclosure during any proceeding or action under the bill.
  9 27    The bill also provides that the bill is not to be construed
  9 28 as creating or recognizing a right to an abortion, and the
  9 29 bill is not to be construed as determining life to begin at 20
  9 30 weeks' gestation; instead, it is recognized that life begins
  9 31 at conception.
  9 32    The bill includes a severability clause as is applicable to
  9 33 every Act or statute pursuant to Code section 4.12.

  7 22 or induced unless the physician performing or inducing the
  7 23 abortion has first made a determination of the probable

  7 27 pregnant woman when it has been determined, that the probable
  7 28 postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks unless, in the

  7 30 woman has a condition which the physician deems a medical

  7 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 19    This bill relates to abortions. The bill provides that,
  7 20 except in the case of a medical emergency, an abortion shall
  7 21 not be performed or induced or be attempted to be performed
  7 22 or induced unless the physician performing or inducing the
  7 23 abortion has first made a determination of the probable
  7 24 postfertilization age of the human pregnancy. Additionally,
  7 25 the bill prohibits a physician from performing or inducing
  7 26 or attempting to perform or induce an abortion upon a
  7 27 pregnant woman when it has been determined, that the probable
  7 28 postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks unless, in the
  7 29 physician's reasonable medical judgment, either the pregnant
  7 30 woman has a condition which the physician deems a medical
  7 31 emergency or it is necessary to preserve the life of the
  7 32 unborn child. If an abortion is performed or induced when
  7 33 the probable postfertilization age is 20 or more weeks, the
  7 34 physician is required to terminate the pregnancy in a manner
  7 35 which, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, provides
  8  1 the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless
  8  2 such termination would pose a greater risk either of the death
  8  3 of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible
  8  4 physical impairment of a major bodily function of the woman
  8  5 than would another available method.
  8  6    The bill also requires certain reports to be filed by a
  8  7 physician who performs or induces or attempts to perform or
  8  8 induce an abortion with the department of public health, on
  8  9 a schedule and in accordance with forms and rules adopted by
  8 10 the department. The department is required to compile the
  8 11 information collected annually and issue a public report,
  8 12 ensuring that none of the information included in the public
  8 13 reports could reasonably lead to the identification of any
  8 14 pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed. The bill
  8 15 provides monetary penalties for a physician who fails to submit
  8 16 a report in a timely manner, submits an incomplete report, or
  8 17 intentionally or recklessly falsifies a required report.
  8 18    The bill provides for civil and criminal actions and
  8 19 penalties relating to violations of the bill. Failure of a
  8 20 physician to comply with any provision, with the exception of
  8 21 the late filing of a report or failure to submit a complete
  8 22 report in compliance with a court order, is grounds for license
  8 23 discipline. A physician who intentionally or recklessly
  8 24 performs or attempts to perform an abortion in violation of the
  8 25 bill is guilty of a class "C" felony, which is punishable by
  8 26 confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of at least
  8 27 $1,000 but not more than $10,000. The bill also provides that
  8 28 a medical facility licensed in the state in which abortions
  8 29 are performed or induced in violation of the bill is subject
  8 30 to immediate revocation of licensure. Additionally, a
  8 31 medical facility licensed in this state in which abortions are
  8 32 performed or induced in violation of the bill is ineligible to
  8 33 receive state funding and is subject to repayment of any state
  8 34 funds received from the state during the time after which an
  8 35 abortion in violation of the bill was performed or induced.
  9  1 However, the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or was
  9  2 attempted to be performed is not subject to prosecution for a
  9  3 violation of the bill. The bill provides for the maintaining
  9  4 of actions by certain people based on alleged violations of
  9  5 the bill. A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in
  9  6 violation of the bill or the biological father may maintain
  9  7 an action against the physician who performed the abortion
  9  8 in intentional or reckless violation of the bill for actual
  9  9 damages. A woman upon whom an abortion has been attempted
  9 10 in violation of the bill may maintain an action against the
  9 11 physician who attempted to perform the abortion in intentional
  9 12 or reckless violation of the bill for actual damages.
  9 13 Additionally, a cause of action for injunctive relief to
  9 14 prevent a physician from performing abortions may be maintained
  9 15 against a physician who has intentionally violated the bill by
  9 16 the woman upon whom the abortion was performed or attempted
  9 17 to be performed, by the spouse of the woman, by a parent or
  9 18 guardian of the woman if the woman is less than 18 years of

  9 20 attempted to be performed, by a current or former licensed
  9 21 health care provider of the woman, by a county attorney with
  9 22 appropriate jurisdiction, or by the attorney general.
