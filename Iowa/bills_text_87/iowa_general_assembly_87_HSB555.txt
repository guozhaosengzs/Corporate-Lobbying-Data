EXPLANATION

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
5


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
6


This
bill
relates
to
sexually
violent
predators,
the
7


accumulation
of
earned
time
by
offenders,
and
providing
8


penalties.
9


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
permitting
a
person
committed
10


as
a
sexually
violent
predator
under
Code
chapter
229A
11


(committed
person)
to
be
released
from
a
secure
facility
or
a
12


transitional
release
program
without
supervision.
Currently,
a
13


committed
person
may
be
released
with
or
without
supervision.
14


Current
law
provides
that
a
final
hearing
on
the
status
of
15


the
committed
person
shall
be
held
if
a
committed
person
shows
16


by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
such
a
final
hearing
17


should
be
held
to
determine
either
the
mental
abnormality
18


of
the
committed
person
has
so
changed
that
the
person
is
19


not
likely
to
engage
in
predatory
acts
constituting
sexually
20


violent
offenses
or
the
committed
person
is
suitable
for
21


placement
in
a
transitional
release
program.
22


If
the
committed
person
proves
by
a
preponderance
of
the
23


evidence
that
a
final
hearing
should
be
held,
current
law
24


requires
the
court
to
set
the
final
hearing
within
60
days
of
25


that
determination.
After
the
court’s
determination
that
a
26


final
hearing
should
be
held,
the
bill
permits
the
committed
27


person
to
waive
the
requirement
that
a
final
hearing
be
held
28


within
60
days
of
the
court’s
determination;
however,
the
29


committed
person
or
the
attorney
for
the
committed
person
30


may
reassert
a
demand
that
a
final
hearing
be
held
within
60
31


days
from
the
date
of
filing
the
demand
with
the
clerk
of
the
32


district
court.
33


Currently,
a
committed
person
may
be
released
to
a
34


transitional
release
program.
If

from
the
transitional
release
program,
current
law
requires
1


the
court
to
set
a
hearing
within
five
days
of
the
committed
2


person’s
return
to
a
secure
facility
in
order
to
determine
if
a

violation
occurred.
The
bill
strikes
the
requirement
that
such
4


a
hearing
be
held
within
five
days
of
the
committed
person’s
5


return
to
a
secure
facility.
6


Under
the
bill,
if
the
court
or
jury
has
determined
that
a
7


committed
person
should
be
released
from
a
secure
facility
or
a
8


transitional
release
program,
but
the
court
has
determined
the
9


committed
person
suffers
from
a
mental
abnormality
and
it
is
10


in
the
best
interest
of
the
community,
the
court
shall
release
11


the
committed
person
with
supervision
prior
to
discharge.
12


Under
current
law,
if
the
court
or
jury
has
determined
that
a
13


committed
person
should
be
discharged
from
the
sexually
violent
14


predator
program,
the
court
may
release
the
committed
person
15


with
or
without
supervision
prior
to
such
discharge
if
the
16


court
determines
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
community.
17


If
a
committed
person
is
released
with
supervision,
the
18


bill
specifies
that
a
judicial
district
of
department
of
19


correctional
services
shall
not
be
held
liable
for
any
acts
20


of
the
committed
person.
Currently,
the
department
of
human
21


services
is
the
only
designated
agency
that
is
not
liable
for
22


the
acts
of
a
committed
person
released
with
supervision.
23


If
a
person
is
released
with
supervision,
and
the
person
24


absconds
in
violation
of
the
release
plan,
the
bill
strikes
25


the
requirement
that
a
hearing
be
held
within
five
days
of
the
26


committed
person’s
return
to
a
secure
facility
in
order
to
27


determine
if
a
violation
occurred.


28


Under
current
law,
any
medical
or
treatment
reports
of
29


the
committed
person
or
victim
impact
statements
which
have
30


been
submitted
to
the
court
or
admitted
into
evidence
shall


31


be
sealed
and
opened
only
upon
order
of
the
court.
The
bill
32


specifies
that
the
documents
under

shall
be
made
available
33


to
the
prosecuting
attorney,
attorney
general,
