  5 11 farm operation was located for at least one year prior to the
  5 12 date of initiation of negotiations for the acquisition of the
  5 13 real property and if the displaced person purchases comparable
  5 14 replacement real property to conduct the displaced person's
  5 15 business or farm operation within eighteen months following the
  5 16 date the displaced person vacates the real property or receives
  5 17 payment from the displacing agency under another provision of
  5 18 this chapter, whichever is later. The additional payment shall
  5 19 include the following amounts:
  5 20    a.  An amount that when added to the acquisition cost of
  5 21 the real property acquired by the displacing agency, excluding
  5 22 any dwelling on the property, equals the reasonable cost of
  5 23 comparable real property for the displaced person's business
  5 24 or farm operation, as determined by an appraiser selected by
  5 25 the displacing agency. In the absence of available replacement
  5 26 real property, the amount of the payment under this paragraph
  5 27 shall be the difference between the acquisition cost of the
  5 28 real property acquired by the displacing agency and the sum
  5 29 of the estimated cost of comparable land and the estimated
  5 30 cost of constructing comparable improvements on the land

  5 34 displacing agency, the displaced person may, at the expense
  5 35 of the displacing agency, select an independent appraiser to
  6  1 determine the amounts required under this paragraph. If the
  6  2 amount determined by the appraiser selected by the displaced
  6  3 person and the amount determined by the appraiser selected by
  6  4 the displacing agency are not equal and the displacing agency
  6  5 and the displaced person cannot agree on an appropriate amount,
  6  6 the amount under this paragraph shall be the average of such
  6  7 amounts determined by the appraisers.
  6  8    b.  An amount that compensates the displaced person for
  6  9 any increased interest costs and other debt service costs
  6 10 that the displaced person is required to pay for financing
  6 11 the acquisition of comparable replacement real property. The
  6 12 amount shall be paid only if the real property acquired by
  6 13 the displacing agency was encumbered by a bona fide mortgage
  6 14 or land contract creating a valid lien on the real property,
  6 15 excluding the dwelling, or on the dwelling, for not less than
  6 16 one year immediately prior to the initiation of negotiations
  6 17 for the acquisition of the real property.
  6 18    c.  The amount of actual, reasonable, and necessary expenses
  6 19 incurred by the displaced person for evidence of title,
  6 20 recording fees, and other costs incident to the purchase of
  6 21 comparable replacement real property, but not including prepaid
  6 22 expenses.
  6 23    2.  In addition to payments otherwise authorized by this
  6 24 chapter, the displacing agency shall make a payment to a
  6 25 displaced person or a person who is displaced from the person's
  6 26 place of business or farm operation as an indirect result of
  6 27 the acquisition of real property by the displacing agency
  6 28 if the person in whole or in part owns the business or farm
  6 29 operation, the person leased the real property upon which the
  6 30 business was conducted or where the farm operation was located
  6 31 for at least one year prior to the date of initiation of
  6 32 negotiations for the acquisition of the real property, and the
  6 33 person leases or purchases comparable replacement real property
  6 34 to conduct the displaced person's business or farm operation
  6 35 within eighteen months of the date the person vacates the
