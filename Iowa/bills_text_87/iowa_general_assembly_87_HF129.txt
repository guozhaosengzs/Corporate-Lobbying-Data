  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.

  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the

  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage

  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the

  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  8 14 21, 2018.

  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section

  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  8 14 21, 2018.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  8 14 21, 2018.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section

  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the

  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  9 force.

  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  8 14 21, 2018.

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.

  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  4 32 female=dominated occupations, child=rearing responsibilities,
  4 33 the number of women who are heads of households, education,

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task

  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and

  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section

  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an

  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing

  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job

  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the

  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the

  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an

  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to

  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  8 14 21, 2018.

  4 29 disparities, including segregation between women and
  4 30 men and between minorities and nonminorities across and
  4 31 within occupations, payment of lower wages for work in
  4 32 female=dominated occupations, child=rearing responsibilities,
  4 33 the number of women who are heads of households, education,
  4 34 hours worked, and years on the job.
  4 35    c.  The consequences of such disparities on the economy and

  5 10 reimbursement for actual expenses incurred while serving
  5 11 in their official capacity only if they are not eligible
  5 12 for reimbursement by the organization that they represent.
  5 13 Legislative members shall be paid the per diem and expenses
  5 14 specified in section 2.10.
  5 15    6.  The task force shall submit a report regarding its
  5 16 findings and its recommendations regarding potential actions
  5 17 for the elimination and prevention of disparities in wages
  5 18 between men and women and minorities and nonminorities to the
  5 19 governor and the general assembly no later than December 21,

  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or

  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a

  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  5 14 specified in section 2.10.

  5 17 for the elimination and prevention of disparities in wages

  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings

  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing

  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a

  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current

  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state

  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December
  8 14 21, 2018.

  5  8 members of the task force constitutes a quorum.

  5 10 reimbursement for actual expenses incurred while serving
  5 11 in their official capacity only if they are not eligible
  5 12 for reimbursement by the organization that they represent.
  5 13 Legislative members shall be paid the per diem and expenses
  5 14 specified in section 2.10.
  5 15    6.  The task force shall submit a report regarding its
  5 16 findings and its recommendations regarding potential actions
  5 17 for the elimination and prevention of disparities in wages
  5 18 between men and women and minorities and nonminorities to the
  5 19 governor and the general assembly no later than December 21,
  5 20 2018.

  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history

  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section

  5 21                           EXPLANATION
  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.

  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,

  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.

  5 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 24    This bill relates to wage discrimination under Iowa Code
  5 25 chapter 216, the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965, and state
  5 26 contracting, and establishes an equal pay task force.
  5 27    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN STATE CONTRACTING.  The bill requires
  5 28 a nonstate party to a contract for goods or services with the
  5 29 state to submit certain information regarding each of its
  5 30 employees in a report to the department of administrative
  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities
  8 13 to the governor and the general assembly no later than December

  5 31 services and the civil rights commission annually by January 1
  5 32 for purposes of ensuring compliance with Code chapters 19B and
  5 33 216. The required information is an employee's total annual
  5 34 compensation, occupation, sex, race, length of employment,
  5 35 highest level of education attained, and years of experience
  6  1 relevant to the employee's job. Names of employees shall not
  6  2 be included in the report.
  6  3    WAGE DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT.  The bill establishes
  6  4 additional unfair or discriminatory practices relating to wages
  6  5 under Code section 216.6A.  Penalty and remedial provisions
  6  6 for discriminatory employment practices, including penalties
  6  7 specific to wage discrimination, are applicable under Code
  6  8 chapter 216 to violations of these requirements.
  6  9    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring that an
  6 10 employee refrain from disclosing, discussing, or sharing
  6 11 information about the amount of the employee's wages, benefits,
  6 12 or other compensation or from inquiring, discussing, or sharing
  6 13 information about any other employee's wages, benefits, or
  6 14 other compensation as a condition of employment. The bill
  6 15 prohibits an employer from requiring that an employee sign a
  6 16 waiver or other document that requires an employee to refrain
  6 17 from engaging in any of those activities as a condition of
  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.

  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.

  6 18 employment. The bill prohibits an employer from discriminating
  6 19 or retaliating against an employee for engaging in any of the
  6 20 activities.
  6 21    The bill prohibits an employer from seeking salary history
  6 22 information from a potential employee as a condition of a job
  6 23 interview or employment. This provision shall not be construed
  6 24 to prohibit a prospective employer from asking a prospective
  6 25 employee what salary level the prospective employee would
  6 26 require in order to accept a job.
  6 27    The bill prohibits an employer from releasing the salary
  6 28 history of any current or former employee to any prospective
  6 29 employer in response to a request as part of an interview or
  6 30 hiring process without written authorization from such current
  6 31 or former employee.
  6 32    The bill prohibits an employer from publishing, listing, or
  6 33 posting within the employer's organization, with any employment
  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
  7  2 employer's organization without including the minimum rate of
  7  3 pay of the position. The rate of pay shall include overtime
  7  4 and allowances, if any, claimed as part of the minimum wage,
  7  5 including but not limited to tipped wages. The bill prohibits
  7  6 an employer from paying a newly hired employee at less than the
  7  7 rate of pay advertised for the employee's position.
  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential
  7 10 is based on any other factor other than prohibited wage
  7 11 discrimination. The bill provides that an employer has an
  7 12 affirmative defense to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a
  7 13 pay differential is based on any other bona fide factor other
  7 14 than prohibited discrimination, including but not limited
  7 15 to a bona fide factor relating to education, training, or
  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to
  7 32 establish a statewide, toll=free telephone hotline for the
  7 33 purpose of receiving reports of violations of Code section
  7 34 216.6A.
  7 35    EQUAL PAY TASK FORCE.  The bill creates an equal pay task
  8  1 force to study the extent of discriminatory wage disparities
  8  2 in the public and private sectors, the factors that cause
  8  3 such disparities, the consequences of such disparities, and
  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.
  8 10    The task force shall submit a report regarding its findings
  8 11 and its recommendations regarding potential actions for the
  8 12 elimination and prevention of discriminatory wage disparities

  7  8    Under current law, an employer has an affirmative defense
  7  9 to a claim under Code section 216.6A if a pay differential

  7 16 experience. However, this defense shall only apply if the
  7 17 employer demonstrates that the factor is not based on or
  7 18 derived from prohibited wage discrimination, is job related
  7 19 with respect to the position in question, and is consistent
  7 20 with a business necessity. The bill defines "business
  7 21 necessity" as an overriding legitimate business purpose
  7 22 such that the factor relied upon effectively fulfills the
  7 23 business purpose it is supposed to serve. This affirmative
  7 24 defense shall not apply if the employee demonstrates that an
  7 25 alternative business practice exists that would serve the same
  7 26 business purpose without producing the wage differential.
  7 27    The bill provides that affirmative defenses to a claim under
  7 28 Code section 216.6A are not applicable unless one or more of
  7 29 the defenses account for the entire pay differential that is
  7 30 the subject of the claim.
  7 31    The bill also requires the civil rights commission to

  8  4 actions likely to lead to the elimination and prevention of
  8  5 such disparities.
  8  6    The bill establishes the membership of the task force,
  8  7 including ex officio, nonvoting legislative members. The civil
  8  8 rights commission shall provide staffing services for the task
  8  9 force.

  6 34 agency, job=listing service, or internet site, or in any other
  6 35 public manner, an advertisement to recruit candidates for
  7  1 hire or independent contractors to fill a position within the
