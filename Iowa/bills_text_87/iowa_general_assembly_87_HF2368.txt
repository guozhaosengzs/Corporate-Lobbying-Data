  3 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 26    This bill concerns the providing of certain veterans'
  3 27 benefits services and the conducting of events related to
  3 28 veterans' benefits.
  3 29    The bill repeals current Code chapter 546B regarding
  3 30 veterans' benefits assistance and disclosures and provides for
  3 31 new provisions governing the providing of certain veterans'
  3 32 benefits.  Current law requires the provision of certain
  3 33 disclosures if a person advertises or provides veterans'
  3 34 benefit services and requires the department of veterans
  3 35 affairs to develop a written disclosure statement for purposes
  4  1 of the current Code chapter.  In addition, current law provides
  4  2 a maximum $1,000 civil penalty per violation and further
  4  3 provides that any penalties recovered would be deposited in the
  4  4 veterans trust fund.
  4  5    New Code section 546B.1 provides definitions governing the
  4  6 new Code chapter.  Terms defined include compensation, person,
  4  7 trade or commerce, veteran, and veterans' benefit matter.
  4  8 Specifically, the bill defines a veterans' benefit matter as
  4  9 any activity related to a claim affecting a person regarding
  4 10 any application for certain veterans' benefits for veterans and
  4 11 their dependents and survivors.
  4 12    New Code section 546B.2 provides for the disclosures
  4 13 required for any person advertising or promoting any event,
  4 14 presentation, seminar, workshop, or other public gathering
  4 15 regarding veterans' benefits or entitlements.  The new Code
  4 16 section specifies the form of the disclosure which generally
  4 17 provides that the event is not sponsored by a governmental
  4 18 agency for veterans or by any officially recognized
  4 19 organization of veterans.  The new Code section requires the
  4 20 disclosure be disseminated, both orally and in writing, at
  4 21 the beginning of an event related to veterans' benefits and
  4 22 entitlements.  The new Code section also specifies certain
  4 23 face and font requirements for a written disclosure.  The new
  4 24 Code section also provides that the disclosure is not required
  4 25 if permission from a governmental agency for veterans or by
  4 26 any officially recognized organization of veterans to use the
  4 27 agency's or organization's name for the event has been provided
  4 28 or if the event is part of an accredited continuing legal
  4 29 education course.
  4 30    New Code section 546B.3 describes those acts that would
  4 31 constitute a violation of the new Code chapter.  Specifically,
  4 32 a violation occurs if a person receives compensation for
  4 33 advising or assisting another person with a veterans' benefit
  4 34 matter or for referring a person to a person accredited by the
  4 35 United States department of veterans affairs, uses financial
  5  1 or other personal information gathered in order to prepare
  5  2 documents for, or represent the interests of, another in
  5  3 a veterans' benefit matter, guarantees a certain level of
  5  4 benefits, or fails to provide the disclosures required by the
  5  5 new Code chapter.
  5  6    New Code section 546B.4 provides that the new Code chapter
  5  7 does not apply to government employees or volunteers acting in
  5  8 their official capacity.
  5  9    New Code section 546B.5 provides that a violation of this new
  5 10 Code chapter is a violation of Code section 714.16, subsection
  5 11 2, paragraph "a", an unfair practice related to consumer
  5 12 frauds. Code section 714.16 provides for the ability of the
  5 13 attorney general to obtain injunctive relief related to the
  5 14 unfair practice and the ability to recover a civil penalty
  5 15 of up to $40,000 per violation. The new Code section also
  5 16 provides that any civil penalty recovered for a violation of
  5 17 the new Code chapter shall be deposited in the veterans trust
  5 18 fund.

  3 35 affairs to develop a written disclosure statement for purposes
  4  1 of the current Code chapter.  In addition, current law provides
  4  2 a maximum $1,000 civil penalty per violation and further
