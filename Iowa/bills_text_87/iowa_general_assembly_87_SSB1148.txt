This
bill
relates
to
asset
forfeiture
and
includes
a
10


prohibition
on
civil
asset
forfeiture
for
property
valued
at
11


less
than
a
minimum
amount,
increases
the
standard
of
proof
12


required
for
asset
forfeiture
to
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
13


prohibits
the
transfer
of
seized
property
to
the
federal
14


government
for
forfeiture
for
property
valued
at
less
than
a
15


minimum
amount,
requires
a
proportionality
review
with
regard
16


to
property
to
be
forfeited,
and
requires
law
enforcement
17


agencies
to
retain
certain
records
related
to
asset
forfeiture.
18


CIVIL
ASSET
FORFEITURE.
Asset
forfeiture
is
a
process
by
19


which
contraband
and
proceeds
or
instrumentalities
related
20


to
criminal
activity
may
be
seized
by
the
state
and
sold.
21


Under
current
law,
conduct
giving
rise
to
forfeiture
is
an
22


act
or
omission
which
is
a
public
offense
that
is
a
serious
23


or
aggravated
misdemeanor
or
felony.
However,
forfeiture
24


proceedings
are
not
precluded
if
the
state
fails
to
convict,
25


indict,
or
charge
the
person
whose
conduct
gave
rise
to
26


forfeiture.


27


Under
the
bill,
asset
forfeiture
for
property
valued
at
less
28


than
$15,000
is
prohibited
unless
the
conduct
giving
rise
to
29


forfeiture
resulted
in
a
conviction,
the
property
owner
is
30


deceased,
charges
were
filed
and
an
arrest
warrant
was
issued
31


but
law
enforcement
is
not
able
to
execute
the
arrest
due
to
32


the
property
owner
being
out
of
state
or
not
locatable,
or
33


the
property
owner
has
not
claimed
the
property
subject
to
34


forfeiture
or
asserted
any
interest
in
the
property.

S.F.
_____


“Conviction”
is
defined
to
include
a
finding
of
guilt,
a
plea
1


of
guilty,
deferred
judgment,
deferred
or
suspended
sentence,
2


adjudication
of
delinquency,
or
circumstances
where
a
person
3


is
not
charged
with
a
criminal
offense
that
is
a
serious
or
4


aggravated
misdemeanor
or
felony
related
to
the
action
for
5


forfeiture
based
in
whole
or
in
part
on
the
person’s
agreement
6


to
provide
information
regarding
the
criminal
activity
of
7


another
person.
8


The
bill
provides
that
the
minimum
threshold
of
$15,000
is
9


to
be
annually
increased
or
decreased
in
accordance
with
the
10


consumer
price
index.
11


BURDEN
OF
PROOF.
Under
current
law,
a
prosecuting
attorney
12


must
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
property
is
13


subject
to
forfeiture
and
that
the
defendant’s
conduct
gave
14


rise
to
forfeiture.
The
bill
provides
that
the
prosecuting
15


attorney
must
prove
these
elements
by
clear
and
convincing
16


evidence.
17


Under
current
law,
if
a
property
claimant
comes
forward
with
18


some
evidence
supporting
the
existence
of
an
exemption
for
19


forfeiture,
the
state
must
provide
some
evidence
to
negate
the
20


assertion,
which
must
be
substantial,
though
may
be
less
than
21


a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
The
bill
provides
that
if
a
22


claimant
asserts
the
existence
of
an
exemption,
the
prosecuting
23


attorney
has
the
burden
of
proving
by
clear
and
convincing
24


evidence
that
the
exemption
does
not
apply.
25


Under
current
law,
a
presumption
arises
that
property
of
a
26


person
is
subject
to
forfeiture
if
the
state
establishes
that
27


the
person
has
engaged
in
conduct
giving
rise
to
forfeiture.
28


The
bill
provides
that
if
the
property
to
be
forfeited
is
less
29


than
the
minimum
civil
forfeiture
amount,
such
a
presumption
30


only
arises
if
the
person
was
convicted
for
the
conduct
giving
31


rise
to
forfeiture.


32


Under
current
law,
a
court
may
order
the
forfeiture
of
33


substitute
assets
if
the
forfeitable
property
cannot
be
34


located;
has
been
transferred
or
conveyed
to,
sold
to,
or

while

not

the
actual

of
the

the

the
prosecuting

or

that

or
is
subject
to
any
interest
of
another
person
6


which
is
exempt
from
forfeiture
under
Code
chapter
809A.
The
7


bill
requires
the
prosecuting
attorney
to
prove
one
of
the
8


above
conditions
of
the
property
by
clear
and
convincing
9


evidence.
10


EQUITABLE
SHARING.
Under
current
law,
there
is
no
11


limitation
on
a
law
enforcement
agency
or
prosecuting
authority
12


with
regard
to
the
transfer
of
seized
property
to
a
federal
13


law
enforcement
agency
or
authority,
a
process
referred
to
as
14


equitable
sharing.
Under
equitable
sharing,
property
seized
15


by
state
authorities
is
transferred
to
federal
authorities
for
16


forfeiture,
and
the
state
and
federal
authorities
then
share
17


the
proceeds.
The
bill
provides
that
a
state
law
enforcement
18


agency
or
prosecuting
authority
shall
not
participate
in
19


equitable
sharing
unless
the
value
of
the
seized
property
20


exceeds
$100,000
or
the
property
is
being
transferred
or
21


referred
for
federal
criminal
forfeiture
proceedings.
22


PROPORTIONALITY
REVIEW.
Under
current
Code
chapter
809A,
23


there
is
no
requirement
that
the
value
of
an
instrumentality
24


forfeited
be
proportionate
to
the
crime
committed,
though
25


the
Iowa
supreme
court
has
held
that
forfeiture
can
be
26


unconstitutional
under
the
Eighth
Amendment’s
prohibition
on
27


excessive
fines
if
the
defendant
can
show
that
the
value
of


28


the
property
is
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
crime.
The
29


bill
provides
that
property
shall
not
be
forfeited
as
an
30


instrumentality
to
the
extent
that
the
amount
or
value
of
the
31


property
is
disproportionate
to
the
severity
of
the
offense
32


and
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
has
the
burden
of
showing
33


proportionality
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
Contraband
34


and
proceeds
are
not
subject
to
proportionality
review.
