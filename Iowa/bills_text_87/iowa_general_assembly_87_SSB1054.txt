EXPLANATION
16


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
17


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
18


In
2005,
the
property
assessment
appeal
board
was
19


established.
The
legislation
establishing
the
property
20


assessment
appeal
board
included
a
future
repeal
of
the
board
21


effective
July
1,
2013.
This
future
repeal
provision
was
22


amended
in
2013
to
extend
the
date
of
the
repeal
to
July
1,
23


2018.
In
2015,
the
future
repeal
provision
was
again
extended
24


from
July
1,
2018,
to
July
1,
2021.
25


This
bill
repeals
the
property
assessment
appeal
board’s
26


future
repeal
provisions,
including
the
2013
and
2015
27


amendments
to
those
provisions,
and
makes
corresponding
28


changes.
29


The
bill
also
modifies
language
regarding
the
form
of
filing
30


of
appeals
with
the
property
assessment
appeal
board
by
no
31


longer
requiring
a
separate
notice
of
appeal
and
a
petition,
32


but
instead
only
requiring
the
appeal
to
include
the
contents
33


currently
required
to
be
in
the
petition.
34


The
bill
provides
that
testimony
given
relating
to

before
the
board
is
required
to
be
electronically
recorded,
1


instead
of
transcribed
as
required
under
current
law.
2


The
bill
strikes
a
provision
of
current
law
that
requires
any
3


deliberation
of
the
board
regarding
an
initial
determination
4


to
be
confidential.
5


The
bill
strikes
provisions
in
Code
section
441.38
governing
6


appeals
from
the
property
assessment
appeal
board
to
district
7


court
and
specifies
that
judicial
review
of
board
decisions
are
8


governed
by
Code
chapter
17A
(Iowa
administrative
procedure
9


Act).
However,
the
bill
requires
petitions
for
judicial
review
10


to
be
filed
in
the
county
where
the
property
subject
to
the
11


appeal
is
located,
without
the
option
of
filing
in
Polk
county
12


district
court.
13


Current
law
requires
that
tax
amounts
reduced
due
to
a
14


reduction
in
the
assessment
by
the
property
assessment
appeal
15


board
be
refunded
if
the
taxes
have
already
been
paid.
The
16


bill
provides
that
the
reduced
amount
may
be
refunded
or
17


credited
against
future
property
tax
liability.
18


The
bill
authorizes
the
property
assessment
appeal
board
to
19


adopt
rules
establishing
requirements
for
notices
of
voluntary
20


settlements
in
appeals
before
the
board
to
be
served
upon
21


affected
taxing
districts.
22


The
bill
also
makes
corresponding
changes
and
reorganizes
23


some
provisions
governing
the
property
assessment
appeal
board.
24


The
bill
applies
to
assessment
years
beginning
on
or
after
25


January
1,
2018.
