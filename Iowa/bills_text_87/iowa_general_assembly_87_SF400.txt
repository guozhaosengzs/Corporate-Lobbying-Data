  5 11    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31, which requires
  5 12 certain individual and group health insurance policies,
  5 13 contracts, or plans and plans established pursuant to Code
  5 14 chapter 509A for public employees other than employees of
  5 15 the state to provide coverage benefits for applied behavior
  5 16 analysis for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder.
  5 17    "Autism spectrum disorder" means a complex
  5 18 neurodevelopmental medical disorder characterized by
  5 19 social impairment, communication difficulties, and restricted,
  5 20 repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior.
  5 21    The bill requires coverage for applied behavior analysis
  5 22 that is provided by a board=certified behavior analyst or by
  5 23 a licensed physician or psychologist.  The required maximum
  5 24 benefit for coverage for applied behavior analysis for an
  5 25 individual diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder is
  5 26 $36,000 per year through age 6, $25,000 per year from age 7
  5 27 through age 13, and $12,500 per year from age 14 through age
  5 28 18.
  5 29    Required coverage can be subject to preauthorization, prior
  5 30 approval, or other care management requirements, including
  5 31 limits on the number of visits an individual may make for
  5 32 applied behavior analysis.
  5 33    Required coverage can be subject to dollar limits,
  5 34 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  5 35 other general exclusions or limitations of the coverage that
  6  1 apply to other covered medical or surgical services.
  6  2    The new Code section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  6  3 otherwise available to an individual under a group policy,
  6  4 contract, or plan.
  6  5    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  6  6 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  6  7 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  6  8 service plan.
  6  9    A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan may request
  6 10 to review a treatment plan not more than once every three
  6 11 months during the first year of the treatment plan and not
  6 12 more than once every six months during every year thereafter,
  6 13 unless the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan and
  6 14 the individual's treating physician or psychologist execute
  6 15 an agreement that more frequent review is necessary.  Such
  6 16 an agreement applies only to that individual and does not
  6 17 apply to other individuals receiving applied behavior analysis
  6 18 from a board=certified behavior analyst, a physician, or a
  6 19 psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review of a treatment
  6 20 plan is to be borne by the carrier, organized delivery system,
  6 21 or plan. A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan
  6 22 shall not change the provisions of a treatment plan until the
  6 23 completion of a review of the plan.
  6 24    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  6 25 types of insurance.
  6 26    New Code section 514C.31 applies to third=party provider
  6 27 payment contracts, policies, or plans specified in the
  6 28 bill, or plans established pursuant to Code chapter 509A for
  6 29 public employees other than employees of the state, that are
  6 30 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 31 state on or after January 1, 2018.
  6 32    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  6 33 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  6 34 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  6 35 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  7  1 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  7  2 2018.
  1 34    1.  Notwithstanding the uniformity of treatment requirements
  1 35 of section 514C.6, a group policy, contract, or plan providing
  2  1 for third=party payment or prepayment of health, medical, and
  2  2 surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage benefits for
  2  3 applied behavior analysis provided by a practitioner to covered
  2  4 individuals under nineteen years of age for the treatment of
  2  5 autism spectrum disorder pursuant to a treatment plan if the
  2  6 policy, contract, or plan is either of the following:
  2  7    a.  A policy, contract, or plan issued by a carrier, as
  2  8 defined in section 513B.2, or an organized delivery system

  2 10 who on at least fifty percent of the employer's working days
  2 11 during the preceding calendar year employed more than fifty
  2 12 full=time equivalent employees. In determining the number
  2 13 of full=time equivalent employees of an employer, employers
  2 14 who are affiliated or who are able to file a consolidated tax
  2 15 return for purposes of state taxation shall be considered one
  2 16 employer.
  2 17    b.  A plan established pursuant to chapter 509A for public
  2 18 employees other than employees of the state.
  2 19    2.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise
  2 20 requires:
  2 21    a.  "Applied behavior analysis" means the design,
  2 22 implementation, and evaluation of environmental modifications,
  2 23 using behavioral stimuli and consequences, to produce socially
  2 24 significant improvement in human behavior, including the use of
  2 25 direct observation, measurement, and functional analysis of the
  2 26 relationship between environment and behavior.
  2 27    b.  "Autism spectrum disorder" means a complex
  2 28 neurodevelopmental medical disorder characterized by social
  2 29 impairment, communication difficulties, and restricted,
  2 30 repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior.
  2 31    c.  "Practitioner" means any of the following:
  2 32    (1)  A physician licensed pursuant to chapter 148.
  2 33    (2)  A psychologist licensed pursuant to chapter 154B.
  2 34    (3)  A person who holds a master's degree or a doctoral
  2 35 degree and is certified by a national behavior analyst
  3  1 certification board as a behavior analyst.
  3  2    d.  "Treatment plan" means a plan for the treatment of an
  3  3 autism spectrum disorder developed by a licensed physician
  3  4 or licensed psychologist after a comprehensive evaluation or
  3  5 reevaluation performed in a manner consistent with the most
  3  6 recent clinical report or recommendations of the American
  3  7 academy of pediatrics. "Treatment plan" includes supervisory
  3  8 services, subject to the provisions of subsection 5.
  3  9    3.  a.  The coverage for applied behavior analysis required
  3 10 pursuant to this section shall provide an annual maximum
  3 11 benefit of not less than the following:
  3 12    (1)  For an individual through age six, thirty=six thousand
  3 13 dollars per year.
  3 14    (2)  For an individual age seven through age thirteen,
  3 15 twenty=five thousand dollars per year.
  3 16    (3)  For an individual age fourteen through age eighteen,
  3 17 twelve thousand five hundred dollars per year.
  3 18    b.  Payments made under a group policy, contract, or plan
  3 19 subject to this section on behalf of a covered individual for
  3 20 any treatment other than applied behavior analysis shall not
  3 21 be applied toward the maximum benefit established under this
  3 22 subsection.
  3 23    4.  Coverage required pursuant to this section may be
  3 24 subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  3 25 coinsurance provisions that apply to other medical and surgical
  3 26 services under the policy, contract, or plan, subject to the
  3 27 requirements of subsection 3.
  3 28    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section may be
  3 29 subject to care management provisions of the applicable
  3 30 policy, contract, or plan, including prior authorization,

  4  3 delivery system, or plan and the covered individual's treating
  4  4 physician or psychologist execute an agreement that a more
  4  5 frequent review is necessary.  An agreement giving a carrier,
  4  6 organized delivery system, or plan the right to review the
  4  7 treatment plan of a covered individual more frequently applies
  4  8 only to a particular covered individual receiving applied
  4  9 behavior analysis and does not apply to other individuals
  4 10 receiving applied behavior analysis from a practitioner.
  4 11 The cost of conducting a review under this section shall be
  4 12 paid by the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan. A
  4 13 carrier, organized delivery system, or plan shall not change
  4 14 the provisions of a treatment plan until the completion of a

  4 20 obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  4 21 individualized family service plan, an individualized education

  4 23    9.  This section shall not apply to accident=only,

  5  1 for public employees other than employees of the state, that

  6 10 to review a treatment plan not more than once every three
  6 11 months during the first year of the treatment plan and not

  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31, which requires

  5 14 chapter 509A for public employees other than employees of

  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31, which requires
  5 12 certain individual and group health insurance policies,

  6  3 otherwise available to an individual under a group policy,
  6  4 contract, or plan.
  6  5    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  6  6 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  6  7 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  6  8 service plan.
  6  9    A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan may request
  6 10 to review a treatment plan not more than once every three
  6 11 months during the first year of the treatment plan and not

  6 16 an agreement applies only to that individual and does not

  6 31 state on or after January 1, 2018.
  6 32    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  6 33 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  6 34 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  6 35 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  7  1 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  7  2 2018.
  2  2 surgical coverage benefits shall provide coverage benefits for

  5  4    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  5  5 Act take effect January 1, 2018:

  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31, which requires
  5 12 certain individual and group health insurance policies,
  5 13 contracts, or plans and plans established pursuant to Code
  5 14 chapter 509A for public employees other than employees of
  5 15 the state to provide coverage benefits for applied behavior
  5 16 analysis for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder.
  5 17    "Autism spectrum disorder" means a complex
  5 18 neurodevelopmental medical disorder characterized by
  5 19 social impairment, communication difficulties, and restricted,

  5 21    The bill requires coverage for applied behavior analysis
  5 22 that is provided by a board=certified behavior analyst or by
  5 23 a licensed physician or psychologist.  The required maximum
  5 24 benefit for coverage for applied behavior analysis for an
  5 25 individual diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder is
  5 26 $36,000 per year through age 6, $25,000 per year from age 7
  5 27 through age 13, and $12,500 per year from age 14 through age
  5 28 18.
  5 29    Required coverage can be subject to preauthorization, prior
  5 30 approval, or other care management requirements, including
  5 31 limits on the number of visits an individual may make for
  5 32 applied behavior analysis.
  5 33    Required coverage can be subject to dollar limits,
  5 34 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  5 35 other general exclusions or limitations of the coverage that
  6  1 apply to other covered medical or surgical services.
  6  2    The new Code section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  6  3 otherwise available to an individual under a group policy,
  6  4 contract, or plan.
  6  5    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  6  6 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  6  7 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  6  8 service plan.
  6  9    A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan may request
  6 10 to review a treatment plan not more than once every three
  6 11 months during the first year of the treatment plan and not
  6 12 more than once every six months during every year thereafter,
  6 13 unless the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan and
  6 14 the individual's treating physician or psychologist execute
  6 15 an agreement that more frequent review is necessary.  Such
  6 16 an agreement applies only to that individual and does not
  6 17 apply to other individuals receiving applied behavior analysis
  6 18 from a board=certified behavior analyst, a physician, or a
  6 19 psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review of a treatment
  6 20 plan is to be borne by the carrier, organized delivery system,
  6 21 or plan. A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan
  6 22 shall not change the provisions of a treatment plan until the
  6 23 completion of a review of the plan.
  6 24    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  6 25 types of insurance.
  6 26    New Code section 514C.31 applies to third=party provider
  6 27 payment contracts, policies, or plans specified in the
  6 28 bill, or plans established pursuant to Code chapter 509A for
  6 29 public employees other than employees of the state, that are
  6 30 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 31 state on or after January 1, 2018.
  6 32    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  6 33 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  6 34 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  6 35 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  7  1 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  7  2 2018.

  6 16 an agreement applies only to that individual and does not
  6 17 apply to other individuals receiving applied behavior analysis
  6 18 from a board=certified behavior analyst, a physician, or a
  6 19 psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review of a treatment
  6 20 plan is to be borne by the carrier, organized delivery system,

  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31, which requires
  5 12 certain individual and group health insurance policies,
  5 13 contracts, or plans and plans established pursuant to Code
  5 14 chapter 509A for public employees other than employees of
  5 15 the state to provide coverage benefits for applied behavior
  5 16 analysis for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder.
  5 17    "Autism spectrum disorder" means a complex
  5 18 neurodevelopmental medical disorder characterized by
  5 19 social impairment, communication difficulties, and restricted,
  5 20 repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior.
  5 21    The bill requires coverage for applied behavior analysis
  5 22 that is provided by a board=certified behavior analyst or by
  5 23 a licensed physician or psychologist.  The required maximum
  5 24 benefit for coverage for applied behavior analysis for an
  5 25 individual diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder is
  5 26 $36,000 per year through age 6, $25,000 per year from age 7
  5 27 through age 13, and $12,500 per year from age 14 through age
  5 28 18.
  5 29    Required coverage can be subject to preauthorization, prior
  5 30 approval, or other care management requirements, including
  5 31 limits on the number of visits an individual may make for
  5 32 applied behavior analysis.
  5 33    Required coverage can be subject to dollar limits,
  5 34 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  5 35 other general exclusions or limitations of the coverage that
  6  1 apply to other covered medical or surgical services.
  6  2    The new Code section shall not be construed to limit benefits
  6  3 otherwise available to an individual under a group policy,
  6  4 contract, or plan.

  6  6 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  6 10 to review a treatment plan not more than once every three

  6 13 unless the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan and
  6 14 the individual's treating physician or psychologist execute
  6 15 an agreement that more frequent review is necessary.  Such
  6 16 an agreement applies only to that individual and does not
  6 17 apply to other individuals receiving applied behavior analysis
  6 18 from a board=certified behavior analyst, a physician, or a
  6 19 psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review of a treatment
  6 20 plan is to be borne by the carrier, organized delivery system,
  6 21 or plan. A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan
  6 22 shall not change the provisions of a treatment plan until the
  6 23 completion of a review of the plan.

  3 35 more than once every three months during the first year of

  4  3 delivery system, or plan and the covered individual's treating
  4  4 physician or psychologist execute an agreement that a more
  4  5 frequent review is necessary.  An agreement giving a carrier,
  4  6 organized delivery system, or plan the right to review the
  4  7 treatment plan of a covered individual more frequently applies
  4  8 only to a particular covered individual receiving applied
  4  9 behavior analysis and does not apply to other individuals

  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31, which requires
  5 12 certain individual and group health insurance policies,
  5 13 contracts, or plans and plans established pursuant to Code
  5 14 chapter 509A for public employees other than employees of
  5 15 the state to provide coverage benefits for applied behavior
  5 16 analysis for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder.
  5 17    "Autism spectrum disorder" means a complex
  5 18 neurodevelopmental medical disorder characterized by
  5 19 social impairment, communication difficulties, and restricted,
  5 20 repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior.
  5 21    The bill requires coverage for applied behavior analysis
  5 22 that is provided by a board=certified behavior analyst or by
  5 23 a licensed physician or psychologist.  The required maximum
  5 24 benefit for coverage for applied behavior analysis for an
  5 25 individual diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder is
  5 26 $36,000 per year through age 6, $25,000 per year from age 7
  5 27 through age 13, and $12,500 per year from age 14 through age
  5 28 18.
  5 29    Required coverage can be subject to preauthorization, prior
  5 30 approval, or other care management requirements, including
  5 31 limits on the number of visits an individual may make for
  5 32 applied behavior analysis.
  5 33    Required coverage can be subject to dollar limits,
  5 34 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  5 35 other general exclusions or limitations of the coverage that
  6  1 apply to other covered medical or surgical services.
  6  2    The new Code section shall not be construed to limit benefits

  6  5    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  6  6 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  6 10 to review a treatment plan not more than once every three

  6 13 unless the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan and
  6 14 the individual's treating physician or psychologist execute
  6 15 an agreement that more frequent review is necessary.  Such
  6 16 an agreement applies only to that individual and does not
  6 17 apply to other individuals receiving applied behavior analysis
  6 18 from a board=certified behavior analyst, a physician, or a
  6 19 psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review of a treatment
  6 20 plan is to be borne by the carrier, organized delivery system,
  6 21 or plan. A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan
  6 22 shall not change the provisions of a treatment plan until the
  6 23 completion of a review of the plan.
  6 24    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  6 25 types of insurance.

  6 29 public employees other than employees of the state, that are
  6 30 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 31 state on or after January 1, 2018.
  6 32    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  6 33 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  6 34 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  6 35 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  7  1 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,

  3 20 any treatment other than applied behavior analysis shall not
  3 21 be applied toward the maximum benefit established under this
  3 22 subsection.

  3 34 a review of a treatment plan for a covered individual not
  3 35 more than once every three months during the first year of

  4  3 delivery system, or plan and the covered individual's treating
  4  4 physician or psychologist execute an agreement that a more
  4  5 frequent review is necessary.  An agreement giving a carrier,
  4  6 organized delivery system, or plan the right to review the
  4  7 treatment plan of a covered individual more frequently applies
  4  8 only to a particular covered individual receiving applied
  4  9 behavior analysis and does not apply to other individuals
  4 10 receiving applied behavior analysis from a practitioner.
  4 11 The cost of conducting a review under this section shall be

  5  4    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The following provisions of this
  5  5 Act take effect January 1, 2018:

  5  8                           EXPLANATION
  5  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 11    This bill creates new Code section 514C.31, which requires
  5 12 certain individual and group health insurance policies,
  5 13 contracts, or plans and plans established pursuant to Code
  5 14 chapter 509A for public employees other than employees of
  5 15 the state to provide coverage benefits for applied behavior
  5 16 analysis for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder.
  5 17    "Autism spectrum disorder" means a complex
  5 18 neurodevelopmental medical disorder characterized by
  5 19 social impairment, communication difficulties, and restricted,
  5 20 repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior.
  5 21    The bill requires coverage for applied behavior analysis
  5 22 that is provided by a board=certified behavior analyst or by
  5 23 a licensed physician or psychologist.  The required maximum
  5 24 benefit for coverage for applied behavior analysis for an
  5 25 individual diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder is
  5 26 $36,000 per year through age 6, $25,000 per year from age 7
  5 27 through age 13, and $12,500 per year from age 14 through age
  5 28 18.
  5 29    Required coverage can be subject to preauthorization, prior
  5 30 approval, or other care management requirements, including
  5 31 limits on the number of visits an individual may make for
  5 32 applied behavior analysis.
  5 33    Required coverage can be subject to dollar limits,
  5 34 deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance provisions, or any
  5 35 other general exclusions or limitations of the coverage that
  6  1 apply to other covered medical or surgical services.

  6  3 otherwise available to an individual under a group policy,
  6  4 contract, or plan.
  6  5    The new Code section shall not be construed as affecting
  6  6 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an
  6  7 individualized family service plan, education program, or
  6  8 service plan.
  6  9    A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan may request
  6 10 to review a treatment plan not more than once every three
  6 11 months during the first year of the treatment plan and not
  6 12 more than once every six months during every year thereafter,
  6 13 unless the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan and
  6 14 the individual's treating physician or psychologist execute
  6 15 an agreement that more frequent review is necessary.  Such
  6 16 an agreement applies only to that individual and does not
  6 17 apply to other individuals receiving applied behavior analysis
  6 18 from a board=certified behavior analyst, a physician, or a
  6 19 psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review of a treatment
  6 20 plan is to be borne by the carrier, organized delivery system,
  6 21 or plan. A carrier, organized delivery system, or plan
  6 22 shall not change the provisions of a treatment plan until the
  6 23 completion of a review of the plan.
  6 24    The new Code section does not apply to various specified
  6 25 types of insurance.

  6 28 bill, or plans established pursuant to Code chapter 509A for
  6 29 public employees other than employees of the state, that are
  6 30 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 31 state on or after January 1, 2018.
  6 32    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and
  6 33 225D.2 to provide that persons who are eligible for coverage
  6 34 of applied behavior analysis treatment under new Code section
  6 35 514C.31 are not eligible to participate in the state autism
  7  1 support program. These changes also take effect January 1,
  7  2 2018.
  3 20 any treatment other than applied behavior analysis shall not
  3 21 be applied toward the maximum benefit established under this
  3 22 subsection.
  3 23    4.  Coverage required pursuant to this section may be
  3 24 subject to dollar limits, deductibles, copayments, or
  3 25 coinsurance provisions that apply to other medical and surgical
  3 26 services under the policy, contract, or plan, subject to the
  3 27 requirements of subsection 3.
  3 28    5.  Coverage required pursuant to this section may be
  3 29 subject to care management provisions of the applicable
  3 30 policy, contract, or plan, including prior authorization,
  3 31 prior approval, and limits on the number of visits a covered
  3 32 individual may make for applied behavior analysis.

  4  3 delivery system, or plan and the covered individual's treating
  4  4 physician or psychologist execute an agreement that a more
  4  5 frequent review is necessary.  An agreement giving a carrier,
  4  6 organized delivery system, or plan the right to review the
  4  7 treatment plan of a covered individual more frequently applies
  4  8 only to a particular covered individual receiving applied
  4  9 behavior analysis and does not apply to other individuals
  4 10 receiving applied behavior analysis from a practitioner.
  4 11 The cost of conducting a review under this section shall be
  4 12 paid by the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan. A

  4 14 the provisions of a treatment plan until the completion of a
  4 15 review of the treatment plan.

  4 34 contracts, policies, or plans specified in subsection 1,
  4 35 paragraph "a" or to plans established pursuant to chapter 509A
  5  1 for public employees other than employees of the state, that

  5 14 chapter 509A for public employees other than employees of
  5 15 the state to provide coverage benefits for applied behavior
  5 16 analysis for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder.

  6  6 any obligation to provide services to an individual under an

  6 10 to review a treatment plan not more than once every three
  6 11 months during the first year of the treatment plan and not
  6 12 more than once every six months during every year thereafter,
  6 13 unless the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan and
  6 14 the individual's treating physician or psychologist execute
  6 15 an agreement that more frequent review is necessary.  Such
  6 16 an agreement applies only to that individual and does not
  6 17 apply to other individuals receiving applied behavior analysis
  6 18 from a board=certified behavior analyst, a physician, or a
  6 19 psychologist.  The cost of conducting the review of a treatment
  6 20 plan is to be borne by the carrier, organized delivery system,

  6 30 delivered, issued for delivery, continued, or renewed in this
  6 31 state on or after January 1, 2018.
  6 32    Coordinating changes are made in Code sections 225D.1 and

  3 32 individual may make for applied behavior analysis.

  4  3 delivery system, or plan and the covered individual's treating
  4  4 physician or psychologist execute an agreement that a more

  4  7 treatment plan of a covered individual more frequently applies
  4  8 only to a particular covered individual receiving applied
  4  9 behavior analysis and does not apply to other individuals
  4 10 receiving applied behavior analysis from a practitioner.
  4 11 The cost of conducting a review under this section shall be
  4 12 paid by the carrier, organized delivery system, or plan. A
