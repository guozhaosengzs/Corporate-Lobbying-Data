  3 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 14    This bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity
  3 15 budget adjustment.  The board of directors of a school district
  3 16 with a regular program district cost per pupil that is less
  3 17 than the highest regular program district cost per pupil among
  3 18 all school districts in the state for the same budget year may
  3 19 annually adopt a resolution to receive the budget adjustment
  3 20 authorized in the bill. Following adoption of the resolution
  3 21 the board of directors must within 10 days notify the
  3 22 department of management of the amount of the budget adjustment
  3 23 to be received. The bill requires the resolution adopted by
  3 24 the board of directors to specify the board's intent to use the
  3 25 authorized funding sources without any corresponding increase
  3 26 to the school district's cash reserve levy or other property
  3 27 tax levy of the school district for the current budget year or
  3 28 any future budget year to replenish the funding sources used.
  3 29    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, but

  3 33 program district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  3 34 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  3 35 state multiplied by the district's budget enrollment.  The
  4  1 resolution authorizing the budget adjustment may specify a
  4  2 budget adjustment amount that is less than the maximum amount
  4  3 authorized under the bill. The bill requires the school
  4  4 district to fund the budget adjustment either by using moneys
  4  5 from its unexpended fund balance or by using cash reserve
  4  6 moneys.
  4  7    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  4  8 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  4  9 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  4 10 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  4 11 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  4 12 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  4 13 future budget year.
  4 14    For each budget year that a school district authorizes a
  4 15 budget adjustment under the bill, the department of management
  4 16 is required to, following property tax levy rate calculations
  4 17 and state foundation aid amount calculations under Code
  4 18 chapter 257 or any other applicable provision of law, reduce

  4 20 the school district for that budget year by 1 percent: (1)

  4 25 under Code section 257.29; and (5) school district levy rate
  4 26 for cash reserve under Code section 298.10.
  4 27    Under the bill, if a school district uses funds from its
  4 28 cash reserve during the base year to fund a budget adjustment
  4 29 authorized in the bill, the board of directors of the school
  4 30 district shall include in its general fund budget document
  4 31 information about the amount of the cash reserve used for such
  4 32 purpose.
  4 33    Notwithstanding the May 15 deadline for adopting a
  4 34 resolution to approve the budget adjustment provided for in the
  4 35 bill, for the school budget year beginning July 1, 2017, the

  3 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 14    This bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity
  3 15 budget adjustment.  The board of directors of a school district
  3 16 with a regular program district cost per pupil that is less
  3 17 than the highest regular program district cost per pupil among
  3 18 all school districts in the state for the same budget year may
  3 19 annually adopt a resolution to receive the budget adjustment
  3 20 authorized in the bill. Following adoption of the resolution
  3 21 the board of directors must within 10 days notify the
  3 22 department of management of the amount of the budget adjustment
  3 23 to be received. The bill requires the resolution adopted by
  3 24 the board of directors to specify the board's intent to use the
  3 25 authorized funding sources without any corresponding increase
  3 26 to the school district's cash reserve levy or other property
  3 27 tax levy of the school district for the current budget year or
  3 28 any future budget year to replenish the funding sources used.
  3 29    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, but
  3 30 before July 1, 2020, each eligible school district is eligible
  3 31 for a budget adjustment for that budget year in an amount
  3 32 equal to the difference between the school district's regular
  3 33 program district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  3 34 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the
  3 35 state multiplied by the district's budget enrollment.  The
  4  1 resolution authorizing the budget adjustment may specify a
  4  2 budget adjustment amount that is less than the maximum amount
  4  3 authorized under the bill. The bill requires the school
  4  4 district to fund the budget adjustment either by using moneys
  4  5 from its unexpended fund balance or by using cash reserve
  4  6 moneys.
  4  7    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  4  8 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  4  9 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  4 10 the budget adjustment under the bill is limited to the budget
  4 11 year for which the adjustment was authorized and shall not be
  4 12 included in any computation of a school district's cost for any
  4 13 future budget year.
  4 14    For each budget year that a school district authorizes a
  4 15 budget adjustment under the bill, the department of management
  4 16 is required to, following property tax levy rate calculations
  4 17 and state foundation aid amount calculations under Code
  4 18 chapter 257 or any other applicable provision of law, reduce
  4 19 each of the following property tax levy rates imposed by
  4 20 the school district for that budget year by 1 percent: (1)
  4 21 foundation property tax levy rate under Code section 257.3; (2)
  4 22 additional property tax levy rate under Code section 257.4; (3)
  4 23 instructional support property tax levy rate under Code section

  4 25 under Code section 257.29; and (5) school district levy rate
  4 26 for cash reserve under Code section 298.10.
  4 27    Under the bill, if a school district uses funds from its
  4 28 cash reserve during the base year to fund a budget adjustment
  4 29 authorized in the bill, the board of directors of the school
  4 30 district shall include in its general fund budget document
  4 31 information about the amount of the cash reserve used for such
  4 32 purpose.
  4 33    Notwithstanding the May 15 deadline for adopting a
