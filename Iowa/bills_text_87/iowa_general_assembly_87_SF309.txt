  2 14                           EXPLANATION
  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.
  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties
  3 19 arising from claims resulting from the enactment of the bill
  3 20 for capital gains earned from sales occurring between January
  3 21 1, 2007, and the effective date of the bill to $10,000 in
  3 22 the aggregate, and requires such claims to be filed prior to
  3 23 October 1, 2017.  If the aggregate amount of refund claims
  3 24 exceeds $10,000, the department of revenue is required to
  3 25 prorate the $10,000 among all claimants in relation to each
  3 26 claim amount.
  3 27    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  3 28 retroactively to January 1, 2007, for tax years beginning on
  3 29 or after that date.

  2 14                           EXPLANATION
  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.
  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties
  3 19 arising from claims resulting from the enactment of the bill
  3 20 for capital gains earned from sales occurring between January
  3 21 1, 2007, and the effective date of the bill to $10,000 in
  3 22 the aggregate, and requires such claims to be filed prior to
  3 23 October 1, 2017.  If the aggregate amount of refund claims
  3 24 exceeds $10,000, the department of revenue is required to
  3 25 prorate the $10,000 among all claimants in relation to each
  3 26 claim amount.
  3 27    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  3 28 retroactively to January 1, 2007, for tax years beginning on
  3 29 or after that date.

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.
  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties
  3 19 arising from claims resulting from the enactment of the bill
  3 20 for capital gains earned from sales occurring between January
  3 21 1, 2007, and the effective date of the bill to $10,000 in
  3 22 the aggregate, and requires such claims to be filed prior to
  3 23 October 1, 2017.  If the aggregate amount of refund claims
  3 24 exceeds $10,000, the department of revenue is required to
  3 25 prorate the $10,000 among all claimants in relation to each
  3 26 claim amount.
  3 27    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  3 28 retroactively to January 1, 2007, for tax years beginning on
  3 29 or after that date.

  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an

  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the

  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties
  3 19 arising from claims resulting from the enactment of the bill
  3 20 for capital gains earned from sales occurring between January
  3 21 1, 2007, and the effective date of the bill to $10,000 in

  2 14                           EXPLANATION
  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.
  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties
  3 19 arising from claims resulting from the enactment of the bill
  3 20 for capital gains earned from sales occurring between January
  3 21 1, 2007, and the effective date of the bill to $10,000 in
  3 22 the aggregate, and requires such claims to be filed prior to
  3 23 October 1, 2017.  If the aggregate amount of refund claims
  3 24 exceeds $10,000, the department of revenue is required to
  3 25 prorate the $10,000 among all claimants in relation to each
  3 26 claim amount.
  3 27    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies

  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.
  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.

  2 14                           EXPLANATION
  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.
  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties
  3 19 arising from claims resulting from the enactment of the bill
  3 20 for capital gains earned from sales occurring between January
  3 21 1, 2007, and the effective date of the bill to $10,000 in
  3 22 the aggregate, and requires such claims to be filed prior to
  3 23 October 1, 2017.  If the aggregate amount of refund claims
  3 24 exceeds $10,000, the department of revenue is required to
  3 25 prorate the $10,000 among all claimants in relation to each
  3 26 claim amount.
  3 27    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  3 28 retroactively to January 1, 2007, for tax years beginning on

  2 14                           EXPLANATION
  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.
  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties
  3 19 arising from claims resulting from the enactment of the bill
  3 20 for capital gains earned from sales occurring between January
  3 21 1, 2007, and the effective date of the bill to $10,000 in
  3 22 the aggregate, and requires such claims to be filed prior to
  3 23 October 1, 2017.  If the aggregate amount of refund claims
  3 24 exceeds $10,000, the department of revenue is required to
  3 25 prorate the $10,000 among all claimants in relation to each
  3 26 claim amount.
  3 27    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  3 28 retroactively to January 1, 2007, for tax years beginning on

  2  7 shall prorate the ten thousand dollars among all claimants in

  2 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be

  2 17    Under current law, a taxpayer's net capital gain from the
  2 18 sale of a business, or from the sale of real property used in
  2 19 a business, is exempt from the individual income tax if the
  2 20 taxpayer held the real property or the business for a minimum
  2 21 of 10 years, and materially participated in the business for
  2 22 10 years.  "Material participation" refers to the level of
  2 23 involvement a taxpayer has in the operations of a business, and
  2 24 whether or not any particular taxpayer materially participates
  2 25 in a business is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.
  2 26    This bill requires that for purposes of determining material
  2 27 participation of a taxpayer for the capital gain tax exemption
  2 28 with regard to a partnership, S corporation, limited liability,
  2 29 estate, or trust whose capital gain flows through to the owners
  2 30 or beneficiaries for federal income tax purposes, material
  2 31 participation shall be determined at the owner or beneficiary
  2 32 level according to the activities of each owner or beneficiary.
  2 33    The bill also provides an exception to this material
  2 34 participation requirement for the sale of real property used
  2 35 in a business which, under certain circumstances, attributes
  3  1 the material participation of certain representatives of an
  3  2 estate or trust to the beneficiaries or owners of that estate
  3  3 or trust.  For purposes of determining material participation
  3  4 of a taxpayer with regard to the sale of an estate's or trust's
  3  5 real property used in a business or rental arrangement, all the
  3  6 beneficiaries or owners of the estate or trust shall be treated
  3  7 as materially participating in a business for any year that
  3  8 the decedent or one or more settlors, executors, or trustees
  3  9 of the estate or trust is materially participating in the
  3 10 estate's or trust's business or, if the real property is leased
  3 11 to another person, is materially participating in the lessee's
  3 12 business that uses the real property.  The bill also provides
  3 13 that the 10=year material participation requirement can be
  3 14 satisfied for a beneficiary or owner of an estate or trust by
  3 15 any combination of years of material participation attributable
  3 16 to the beneficiary or owner under the bill, aggregated over the
  3 17 10 years preceding the sale.
  3 18    The bill limits refunds of tax, interest, or penalties
  3 19 arising from claims resulting from the enactment of the bill
  3 20 for capital gains earned from sales occurring between January
  3 21 1, 2007, and the effective date of the bill to $10,000 in
  3 22 the aggregate, and requires such claims to be filed prior to
  3 23 October 1, 2017.  If the aggregate amount of refund claims
  3 24 exceeds $10,000, the department of revenue is required to
  3 25 prorate the $10,000 among all claimants in relation to each
  3 26 claim amount.
