  4  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of provisions in the
  4  8 animal agriculture compliance Act (Code chapter 459) which
  4  9 regulate animal feeding operations by creating a new category
  4 10 of confinement feeding operation referred to as a small
  4 11 confinement feeding operation (SCFO) that would effectively
  4 12 replace the current category referred to as a small animal
  4 13 feeding operation (SAFO).  Currently, in order to qualify as
  4 14 an SAFO, an animal feeding operation's capacity cannot exceed
  4 15 500 animal units (AUs).  A confinement feeding operation
  4 16 would not qualify as an SCFO if its capacity exceeds 250
  4 17 AUs.  Any exemption from a regulation currently available
  4 18 to a confinement feeding operation qualifying as an SAFO
  4 19 would only be available if the confinement feeding operation
  4 20 qualified as an SCFO.  In the case where a current exemption
  4 21 allows an SAFO to be located closer than normally allowed to a
  4 22 benefited object or location (home, school, business, religious
  4 23 institution, road, or public use area), the bill provides the
  4 24 SAFO may continue to operate, but limits how such operation
  4 25 could expand in the same manner as other grandfathered
  4 26 operations.  The bill does not affect exemptions for SAFOs
  4 27 in other Code chapters including  the animal agriculture
  4 28 compliance Act for open feedlot operations and animal truck
  4 29 wash facilities (Code chapter 459A) or the animal agriculture
  4 30 compliance Act for dry bedded confinement feeding operations
  4 31 (Code section 459B).
  4 32    BACKGROUND == EXEMPTIONS.  An SAFO is exempted from
  4 33 regulations that would otherwise require a confinement
  4 34 operation to (1) maintain a separation distance between a
  4 35 confinement feeding operation structure (building or manure
  5  1 storage) and a benefited object or location (Code sections
  5  2 459.202, 459.203, and 459.205), (2) maintain a separation
  5  3 distance between manure applied to land and a home (Code
  5  4 sections 459.204 and 459.205), (3)  maintain a separation
  5  5 distance between a stockpile of dry manure and a home (Code
  5  6 sections 459.204B and 459.205), (4) obtain a permit from
  5  7 the department of natural resources (DNR) to construct a
  5  8 confinement feeding operation structure other than an unformed
  5  9 manure storage structure (Code section 459.303), (5) submit
  5 10 a construction design statement to DNR for the construction
  5 11 of a formed manure storage structure (Code sections 459.306
  5 12 and 459.307), (6) submit an annual manure management plan
  5 13 or update and pay an associated compliance fee to DNR (Code
  5 14 sections 459.312 and 459.400), (7) restrict the application of
  5 15 liquid manure on snow=covered and frozen ground (Code section
  5 16 459.313A), and (8) be certified by DNR to apply manure on land
  5 17 (Code section 459.315).  The bill also provides that an option
  5 18 allowing a confinement feeding operation to become reclassified
  5 19 as an SAFO would apply to allow the operation to be instead
  5 20 reclassified as an SCFO exempt from filing a manure management
  5 21 plan update and paying the annual compliance fee for the period
  5 22 of election (Code sections 459.312A and 459.400).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS AND CONFINEMENT
  5 24 FEEDING OPERATIONS.  An animal feeding operation refers to any
  5 25 area in which animals are confined and fed and maintained for
  5 26 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  5 27 structures including those used to store manure.  A confinement
  5 28 feeding operation is a type of animal feeding operation that
  5 29 includes a building that is totally roofed (as compared to
  5 30 an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited to cattle,
  5 31 swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish (Code section
  5 32 459.102).
  5 33    BACKGROUND == AU CAPACITY.  AU capacity refers to the
  5 34 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained in all
  5 35 confinement buildings associated with the confinement feeding
  6  1 operation at any one time (Code sections 459.102 and 459.201).
  6  2 In calculating AU capacity, each of various types of animals
  6  3 is assigned a special equivalency factor. For example, each
  6  4 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has
  6  5 an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  In
  6  6 order to qualify as an SAFO, a confinement feeding operation
  6  7 must have a capacity of 1,250 or fewer butcher or breeding
  6  8 swine (500 ? 0.4 = 1,250).  In order to qualify as an SCFO,
  6  9 the confinement feeding operation would have to have a maximum
  6 10 capacity of 625 or fewer breeding swine (250 ? 0.4 = 625).

  5 24 FEEDING OPERATIONS.  An animal feeding operation refers to any
  5 25 area in which animals are confined and fed and maintained for
  5 26 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  5 27 structures including those used to store manure.  A confinement
  5 28 feeding operation is a type of animal feeding operation that
  5 29 includes a building that is totally roofed (as compared to
  5 30 an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited to cattle,
  5 31 swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish (Code section

  5 33    BACKGROUND == AU CAPACITY.  AU capacity refers to the
  5 34 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained in all
  5 35 confinement buildings associated with the confinement feeding
  6  1 operation at any one time (Code sections 459.102 and 459.201).
  6  2 In calculating AU capacity, each of various types of animals
  6  3 is assigned a special equivalency factor. For example, each
  6  4 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has
  6  5 an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  In
  6  6 order to qualify as an SAFO, a confinement feeding operation
  6  7 must have a capacity of 1,250 or fewer butcher or breeding
  6  8 swine (500 ? 0.4 = 1,250).  In order to qualify as an SCFO,
  6  9 the confinement feeding operation would have to have a maximum

  5 23    BACKGROUND == ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS AND CONFINEMENT
  5 24 FEEDING OPERATIONS.  An animal feeding operation refers to any
  5 25 area in which animals are confined and fed and maintained for
  5 26 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  5 27 structures including those used to store manure.  A confinement
  5 28 feeding operation is a type of animal feeding operation that
  5 29 includes a building that is totally roofed (as compared to
  5 30 an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited to cattle,
  5 31 swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish (Code section
  5 32 459.102).
  5 33    BACKGROUND == AU CAPACITY.  AU capacity refers to the
  5 34 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained in all
  5 35 confinement buildings associated with the confinement feeding
  6  1 operation at any one time (Code sections 459.102 and 459.201).
  6  2 In calculating AU capacity, each of various types of animals
  6  3 is assigned a special equivalency factor. For example, each
  6  4 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has
  6  5 an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  In
  6  6 order to qualify as an SAFO, a confinement feeding operation
  6  7 must have a capacity of 1,250 or fewer butcher or breeding
  6  8 swine (500 ? 0.4 = 1,250).  In order to qualify as an SCFO,
  6  9 the confinement feeding operation would have to have a maximum
  6 10 capacity of 625 or fewer breeding swine (250 ? 0.4 = 625).

  5 23    BACKGROUND == ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS AND CONFINEMENT
  5 24 FEEDING OPERATIONS.  An animal feeding operation refers to any
  5 25 area in which animals are confined and fed and maintained for
  5 26 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  5 27 structures including those used to store manure.  A confinement
  5 28 feeding operation is a type of animal feeding operation that
  5 29 includes a building that is totally roofed (as compared to
  5 30 an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited to cattle,
  5 31 swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish (Code section
  5 32 459.102).
  5 33    BACKGROUND == AU CAPACITY.  AU capacity refers to the
  5 34 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained in all
  5 35 confinement buildings associated with the confinement feeding
  6  1 operation at any one time (Code sections 459.102 and 459.201).
  6  2 In calculating AU capacity, each of various types of animals
  6  3 is assigned a special equivalency factor. For example, each
  6  4 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has
  6  5 an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  In
  6  6 order to qualify as an SAFO, a confinement feeding operation
  6  7 must have a capacity of 1,250 or fewer butcher or breeding
  6  8 swine (500 ? 0.4 = 1,250).  In order to qualify as an SCFO,
  6  9 the confinement feeding operation would have to have a maximum
  6 10 capacity of 625 or fewer breeding swine (250 ? 0.4 = 625).

  5 23    BACKGROUND == ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS AND CONFINEMENT
  5 24 FEEDING OPERATIONS.  An animal feeding operation refers to any
  5 25 area in which animals are confined and fed and maintained for
  5 26 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  5 27 structures including those used to store manure.  A confinement
  5 28 feeding operation is a type of animal feeding operation that
  5 29 includes a building that is totally roofed (as compared to
  5 30 an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited to cattle,
  5 31 swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish (Code section
  5 32 459.102).
  5 33    BACKGROUND == AU CAPACITY.  AU capacity refers to the
  5 34 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained in all
  5 35 confinement buildings associated with the confinement feeding
  6  1 operation at any one time (Code sections 459.102 and 459.201).
  6  2 In calculating AU capacity, each of various types of animals
  6  3 is assigned a special equivalency factor. For example, each
  6  4 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has
  6  5 an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  In
  6  6 order to qualify as an SAFO, a confinement feeding operation
  6  7 must have a capacity of 1,250 or fewer butcher or breeding
  6  8 swine (500 ? 0.4 = 1,250).  In order to qualify as an SCFO,
  6  9 the confinement feeding operation would have to have a maximum
  6 10 capacity of 625 or fewer breeding swine (250 ? 0.4 = 625).

  5 26 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  5 27 structures including those used to store manure.  A confinement
  5 28 feeding operation is a type of animal feeding operation that
  5 29 includes a building that is totally roofed (as compared to
  5 30 an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited to cattle,
  5 31 swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish (Code section
  5 32 459.102).
  5 33    BACKGROUND == AU CAPACITY.  AU capacity refers to the
  5 34 maximum number of animal units that may be maintained in all
  5 35 confinement buildings associated with the confinement feeding
  6  1 operation at any one time (Code sections 459.102 and 459.201).
  6  2 In calculating AU capacity, each of various types of animals
  6  3 is assigned a special equivalency factor. For example, each
  6  4 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has
  6  5 an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  In
  6  6 order to qualify as an SAFO, a confinement feeding operation
  6  7 must have a capacity of 1,250 or fewer butcher or breeding
  6  8 swine (500 ? 0.4 = 1,250).  In order to qualify as an SCFO,
  6  9 the confinement feeding operation would have to have a maximum
  6 10 capacity of 625 or fewer breeding swine (250 ? 0.4 = 625).

  5 24 FEEDING OPERATIONS.  An animal feeding operation refers to any
  5 25 area in which animals are confined and fed and maintained for
  5 26 45 days or more in any 12=month period, and includes associated
  5 27 structures including those used to store manure.  A confinement
  5 28 feeding operation is a type of animal feeding operation that
  5 29 includes a building that is totally roofed (as compared to
  5 30 an open feedlot).  Confined animals are limited to cattle,
  5 31 swine, horses, sheep, chickens, turkeys, or fish (Code section

  5 35 confinement buildings associated with the confinement feeding
  6  1 operation at any one time (Code sections 459.102 and 459.201).
  6  2 In calculating AU capacity, each of various types of animals
  6  3 is assigned a special equivalency factor. For example, each
  6  4 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has
  6  5 an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  In
  6  6 order to qualify as an SAFO, a confinement feeding operation
  6  7 must have a capacity of 1,250 or fewer butcher or breeding
  6  8 swine (500 ? 0.4 = 1,250).  In order to qualify as an SCFO,
  6  9 the confinement feeding operation would have to have a maximum
  6 10 capacity of 625 or fewer breeding swine (250 ? 0.4 = 625).

  6  3 is assigned a special equivalency factor. For example, each
  6  4 butcher or breeding swine weighing more than 55 pounds has
  6  5 an equivalency factor of 0.4 AUs (Code section 459.102).  In
  6  6 order to qualify as an SAFO, a confinement feeding operation
  6  7 must have a capacity of 1,250 or fewer butcher or breeding
  6  8 swine (500 ? 0.4 = 1,250).  In order to qualify as an SCFO,
  6  9 the confinement feeding operation would have to have a maximum
  6 10 capacity of 625 or fewer breeding swine (250 ? 0.4 = 625).
