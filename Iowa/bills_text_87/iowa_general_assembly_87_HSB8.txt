except
for
1


abstracts
requested
by


state,
county,
or
city
officials,
court
2


officials,
public
transit
officials,
or
other
officials
of
a

political

under
this
section
to
the

9


department
of
administrative
services
for
a
record
furnished
10


through
an
electronic
portal
maintained

the
department

services
shall
transfer
the
moneys

EXPLANATION
16


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
17


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
18


Under
current
law,
commercial
learner’s
permits
are
valid
19


for
180
days
and
may
be
renewed
for
an
additional
180
days
20


without
retaking
the
required
general
and
endorsement
knowledge
21


tests.
This
bill
alters
that
provision
to
incorporate
the
22


validity
and
renewal
periods
provided
by
the
Code
of
Federal
23


Regulations
as
well
as
an
exemption
for
state
driver’s
24


licensing
agencies.
Although
the
Code
of
Federal
Regulations
25


specifies
the
same
180-day
validity
and
renewal
periods,
state
26


driver’s
licensing
agencies
are
currently
exempted
from
those
27


periods
by
the
federal
motor
carrier
safety
administration,
and
28


may
instead
allow
commercial
learner’s
permits
to
be
valid
for
29


one
year
with
no
renewal
period.
30


Vehicular
traffic
is
currently
allowed
to
make
a
right
turn
31


from
the
right
lane
of
traffic
against
a
red
light,
or
a
left
32


turn
from
the
left
lane
of
traffic
on
a
one-way
street
onto
the
33


leftmost
lane
of
traffic
on
another
one-way
street
against
a
34


red
light.
The
bill
alters
that
provision
to
allow
a
right

turn
from
another
lane
designated
for
right
turns,
or
a
left
1


turn
from
another
lane
designated
for
left
turns
on
a
one-way
2


street.
The
bill
also
strikes
the
requirement
that
vehicular
3


traffic
turning
left
against
a
red
light
on
a
one-way
street
4


onto
another
one-way
street
must
turn
into
the
leftmost
lane
5


of
the
street.
6


Under
current
law,
fees
collected
by
the
department
of
7


administrative
services
(DAS)
for
the
furnishing
of
drivers’
8


operating
records
through
an
electronic
portal
maintained
by
9


DAS
are
transferred
to
the
department
of
transportation
which
10


then
transfers
the
moneys
to
the
treasurer
of
state
to
be
11


deposited
in
the
general
fund.
The
bill
requires
that
the
fees
12


collected
by
DAS
be
transferred
directly
to
the
treasurer
of
13


state
to
be
deposited
in
the
general
fund.
