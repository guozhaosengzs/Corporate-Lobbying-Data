  3 19 or sick leave plan shall be applied to an employee's absence
  3 20 due to an adoption on the same terms and conditions as they are
  3 21 applied to temporary disabilities.
  3 22    The bill prohibits an employer from terminating the

  3 33 adoption, or for eight weeks, whichever is less.  The employee
  3 34 must provide timely notice of the period of leave requested.
  3 35 The employer may first require that the employee's adoption
  4  1 of a child be verified by documentation and that the employee
  4  2 certify that the employee will not able to reasonably perform
  4  3 the duties of employment because the employee will be preparing
