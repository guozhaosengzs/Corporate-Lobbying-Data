  3  9 instructional costs of the child during any period of time that
  3 10 the child is at a location outside the boundaries of the state
  3 11 and receiving medically necessary treatment if such treatment
  3 12 makes continuing the child's education through independent
  3 13 coursework, homework, or supplemental educational materials
  3 14 insufficient to provide for the appropriate education of the
  3 15 child.  The bill defines "instructional costs" to mean the

  3  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  7    This bill requires the district of residence of a child
  3  8 who does not require special education to pay for the actual
  3  9 instructional costs of the child during any period of time that
  3 10 the child is at a location outside the boundaries of the state
  3 11 and receiving medically necessary treatment if such treatment
  3 12 makes continuing the child's education through independent
  3 13 coursework, homework, or supplemental educational materials
  3 14 insufficient to provide for the appropriate education of the
  3 15 child.  The bill defines "instructional costs" to mean the
  3 16 cost of tutoring or mentoring conducted in person or over the
  3 17 internet for courses or subjects of instruction that the child
  3 18 is currently enrolled in within the district of residence.

  3 29 board of directors may approve payment for all or a portion

  3 31 the request. The decision of the board of directors must be
  3 32 issued within 30 days after the board receives all information

  3 34 mediation and appeal procedures in the event the request is

  3  9 instructional costs of the child during any period of time that
  3 10 the child is at a location outside the boundaries of the state

  3 14 insufficient to provide for the appropriate education of the
  3 15 child.  The bill defines "instructional costs" to mean the

  4  1 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  4  2 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  4  3 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  4  4 district from state school foundation aid received by the
