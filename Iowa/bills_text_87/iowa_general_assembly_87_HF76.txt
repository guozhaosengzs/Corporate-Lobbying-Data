  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  5 29    b.  The conservation of highly erodible land.

  6  9 466B.

  6 11 including but not limited to the installation of permanent

  7 19 aesthetic, ecological, and social value, and must improve water
  7 20 quality.
  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  6 12 vegetation cover, filter strips, grass waterways, and riparian
  6 13 forest buffers; dredging; and bank stabilization.
  6 14    7.  Thirteen percent of the moneys in each fund shall be used
  6 15 as follows:
  6 16    a.  Fifty=two percent shall be used to support initiatives
  6 17 involving the acquisition, protection, and development of

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement

  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by

  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.

  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support
  8 17 voluntary initiatives and shall not be used for regulatory
  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
  8 19 for two or more cities or counties to enter into an agreement
  8 20 under Code chapter 28E to form an entity in order to carry
  8 21 out any authorized initiative, and allows a city or county to
  8 22 deposit other local sales and services tax revenues it receives
  8 23 in its special natural resources and outdoor recreation fund.
  8 24    The bill also amends the calculation for determining the
  8 25 funding of urban renewal projects with local option sales tax
  8 26 revenues to ensure that such calculation is not impacted by
  8 27 local option sales tax revenues collected on the amount of the
  8 28 tax rate in excess of one percent.

  7 21                           EXPLANATION
  7 22 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 23 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 24    This bill provides for an increase in the maximum local
  7 25 option sales tax rate to fund local natural resources and
  7 26 outdoor recreation projects.
  7 27    BACKGROUND.  Under current law, counties may impose a sales
  7 28 tax at the local level upon a petition of the voters or motions
  7 29 of city councils or the board of supervisors and after an
  7 30 election at which a majority of those voting favors imposition.
  7 31 A majority vote is also required for a repeal or rate change,
  7 32 but the governing body on its own motion may repeal the sales
  7 33 tax under certain circumstances.  The local option sales tax
  7 34 rate may not exceed one percent.
  7 35    Local option tax revenues collected in a county are remitted
  8  1 to the department of revenue (department) and, except for
  8  2 certain revenues attributable to urban renewal projects,
  8  3 distributed back to the county and cities within the county
  8  4 using a statutory formula involving population and historical
  8  5 property tax revenues.
  8  6    BILL CHANGES.  The bill increases the maximum local option
  8  7 sales tax rate that may be imposed by a county to one and
  8  8 three=eighths percent (1.375 percent) from one percent.  If a
  8  9 county votes to initially impose or to increase the tax rate
  8 10 above one percent, the bill requires tax revenues collected
  8 11 on the amount of the tax rate in excess of one percent to be
  8 12 remitted to counties and cities using the existing statutory
  8 13 formula, and then deposited in a special fund of the city or
  8 14 county and used exclusively for funding natural resources and
  8 15 outdoor recreation projects as described in the bill.
  8 16    The special fund moneys shall only be used to support

  8 18 efforts, enforcement actions, or litigation.  The bill allows
