  4 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 18    This bill expands current law to allow any qualified parent
  4 19 to teach driver education to that parent's child if the
  4 20 qualified parent meets certain requirements, including but not
  4 21 limited to applying for a license to teach their child and
  4 22 payment of a $50 fee for a one=year renewable license. Current
  4 23 law allows a parent, guardian, or legal custodian of a student
  4 24 who is providing competent private instruction to that student
  4 25 to teach the student driver education, provided the person has
  4 26 a valid driver's license that permits unaccompanied driving and
  4 27 has a clear driving record for the previous two years.
  4 28    The requirements for a driver education course taught
  4 29 by a qualified parent are the same as the requirements
  4 30 currently applicable to a course taught by a "teaching parent".
  4 31 "Qualified parent" is defined to include a parent, guardian, or
  4 32 legal custodian of a student, provided the person has a valid
  4 33 driver's license that permits unaccompanied driving and has a
  4 34 clear driving record for the previous two years.
  4 35    The classroom instruction requirements for the alternative
  5  1 course of instruction are substantially the same as for an
  5  2 approved course of instruction offered by a public school
  5  3 district or private or commercial driver education school,
  5  4 with additional requirements for 40, rather than 20, hours
  5  5 of street or highway driving including night driving. The
  5  6 course of instruction must be a course approved by the
  5  7 department of transportation by rule and use driver education
  5  8 materials that meet or exceed standards established for driver
  5  9 education courses approved for public or private schools. A
  5 10 list of approved courses must be posted on the department of
  5 11 transportation's internet site. In order for the student to
  5 12 qualify for an intermediate driver's license, the qualified
  5 13 parent is required to document substantial compliance with the
  5 14 driver education course requirements and furnish an affidavit
  5 15 attesting to the student's satisfactory completion of the
  5 16 course work and street or highway driving to the department of
  5 17 education.

  4 20 qualified parent meets certain requirements, including but not
  4 21 limited to applying for a license to teach their child and

  4 24 who is providing competent private instruction to that student
  4 25 to teach the student driver education, provided the person has
  4 26 a valid driver's license that permits unaccompanied driving and
  4 27 has a clear driving record for the previous two years.

  4 29 by a qualified parent are the same as the requirements

  4 31 "Qualified parent" is defined to include a parent, guardian, or
