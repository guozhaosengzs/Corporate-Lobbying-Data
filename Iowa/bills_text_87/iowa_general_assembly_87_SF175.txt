  2  9    Current Code section 257.31(17) authorizes the school budget

  2 12 costs per pupil exceed the state average transportation costs
  2 13 per pupil by 150 percent and if the district meets certain
  2 14 data reporting requirements.  Currently, the funding for such
  2 15 transportation assistance aid comes from a transfer of fees
  2 16 collected from the issuance of certain education license plates
  2 17 under Code section 321.32(34) and is considered miscellaneous
  2 18 income and is not included in district cost.
