  6  6 private entity or person, for any initiative related to the
  6  7 Iowa nutrient reduction strategy or for any other water quality
  6  8 or flood mitigation initiative, shall be made subject to
  6  9 satisfaction of all of the following conditions:
  6 10    1.  The Iowa nutrient reduction strategy is updated to
  6 11 include the interim goals and timelines of the gulf hypoxia
  6 12 Mississippi river task force that call for a twenty percent
  6 13 reduction in nitrates and phosphorus by calendar year 2025.
  6 14    2.  Each initiative shall require a comprehensive
  6 15 watershed=based assessment and planning process open to all
  6 16 landowners and other stakeholders, with an absolute preference
  6 17 for initiatives recommended or conducted by, or included in
  6 18 the plans of, a watershed management authority, with financial
  6 19 participation by local participants based on principles adopted
  6 20 according to the Iowa smart planning principles in chapter 18B.
  6 21    3.  Funding preference shall be given for initiatives that
  6 22 achieve one or more benefits in addition to nutrient reduction,
  6 23 including but not limited to soil health, erosion prevention,
  6 24 flood mitigation, reductions in other pollutants, wildlife
  6 25 habitat creation or preservation, and public recreational
  6 26 access. Trust funds shall not be used for initiatives that are
  6 27 solely demonstration projects or initiatives under the Iowa
  6 28 nutrient reduction strategy.
  6 29    4.  The initiative establishes specific benchmarks,
  6 30 priorities, goals, timelines, and milestones, including
  6 31 regular ambient water quality measurements for the initiative,
  6 32 which are consistent with the goals and timelines of the Iowa
  6 33 nutrient reduction strategy, including but not limited to the
  6 34 changes required in subsection 1.
  6 35    5.  The initiative has its performance evaluated by a
  7  1 competent and independent third=party entity at least once
  7  2 every two years starting from the beginning of the initiative
  7  3 and again at the conclusion of the initiative.
  7  4    6.  The initiative publicly reports participation, progress,
  7  5 and results at least once every two years, which reports shall
  7  6 include, at a minimum, measured changes in water quality.
  7  7    7.  The initiative shall require, at a minimum, at least
  7  8 a fifty percent cost share from landowners or other private
  7  9 entities or persons for improvements to private property,
  7 10 including both installation and maintenance, and including
  7 11 regular maintenance in accordance with public easements for a
  7 12 minimum of twenty years.  Any public moneys appropriated for
  7 13 improvements that are not maintained or that are removed shall
  7 14 be returned to the trust fund.
  7 15                           EXPLANATION
  7 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 18    This bill relates to water quality by increasing the sales
  7 19 and use tax rates and conditioning the use of moneys from the
  7 20 natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund.
  7 21    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
  7 22 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
  7 23 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
  7 24 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
  7 25 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
  7 26 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
  7 27 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
  7 28 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
  7 29 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
  7 30 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
  7 31 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
  7 32 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
  7 33 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
  7 34 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
  7 35 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
  8  1 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
  8  2 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
  8  3 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
  8  4 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
  8  5 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
  8  6 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
  8  7 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
  8  8 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
  8  9 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
  8 10 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
  8 11 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
  8 12    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
  8 13    DIVISION II == NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
  8 14 Division II relates to the natural resources and outdoor
  8 15 recreation trust fund codified in Code chapter 461.  The
  8 16 division defines "Iowa nutrient reduction strategy" for
  8 17 purposes of Code chapter 461.  The division also prescribes
  8 18 numerous conditions that must be satisfied in order for
  8 19 an appropriation of trust fund moneys to be made from the
  8 20 trust fund to any public or private entity or person for an
  8 21 initiative related to the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy,
  8 22 or for another similar water quality or flood mitigation
  8 23 initiative.  The conditions require that the Iowa nutrient
  8 24 reduction strategy be updated to include certain goals and
  8 25 timelines of the gulf hypoxia Mississippi river task force, and
  8 26 in general require initiatives to engage in or include certain
  8 27 assessments, goals, measurements, evaluations, or reports as
  8 28 described in the division, and establishes certain funding
  8 29 preferences and cost=share requirements as described in the
  8 30 division.  The conditions also prohibit trust fund moneys
  8 31 from being used for initiatives that are solely demonstration
  8 32 projects, and requires the repayment of certain public moneys
  8 33 appropriated for improvements to private property if the
  8 34 improvements are not maintained or are removed.

  6 32 which are consistent with the goals and timelines of the Iowa
  6 33 nutrient reduction strategy, including but not limited to the
  6 34 changes required in subsection 1.
  6 35    5.  The initiative has its performance evaluated by a

  7 15                           EXPLANATION
  7 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 18    This bill relates to water quality by increasing the sales
  7 19 and use tax rates and conditioning the use of moneys from the
  7 20 natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund.
  7 21    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
  7 22 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
  7 23 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
  7 24 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
  7 25 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
  7 26 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
  7 27 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
  7 28 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
  7 29 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
  7 30 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
  7 31 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
  7 32 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
  7 33 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
  7 34 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
  7 35 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
  8  1 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
  8  2 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
  8  3 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
  8  4 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
  8  5 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
  8  6 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
  8  7 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
  8  8 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
  8  9 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
  8 10 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
  8 11 use tax rate increases provided in the division.

  7 15                           EXPLANATION
  7 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 18    This bill relates to water quality by increasing the sales
  7 19 and use tax rates and conditioning the use of moneys from the
  7 20 natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund.
  7 21    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
  7 22 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
  7 23 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
  7 24 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
  7 25 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
  7 26 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
  7 27 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
  7 28 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
  7 29 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
  7 30 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount

  7 22 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
  7 23 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
  7 24 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
  7 25 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
  7 26 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
  7 27 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
  7 28 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
  7 29 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
  7 30 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
  7 31 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
  7 32 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
  7 33 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
  7 34 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
  7 35 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
  8  1 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
  8  2 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
  8  3 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
  8  4 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
  8  5 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
  8  6 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
  8  7 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
  8  8 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
  8  9 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
  8 10 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the

  7 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 18    This bill relates to water quality by increasing the sales
  7 19 and use tax rates and conditioning the use of moneys from the
  7 20 natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund.
  7 21    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
  7 22 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
  7 23 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
  7 24 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
  7 25 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
  7 26 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
  7 27 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
  7 28 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
  7 29 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
  7 30 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
  7 31 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
  7 32 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
  7 33 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
  7 34 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
  7 35 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
  8  1 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
  8  2 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
  8  3 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
  8  4 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
  8  5 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
  8  6 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
  8  7 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
  8  8 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
  8  9 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
  8 10 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
