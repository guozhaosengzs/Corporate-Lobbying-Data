  1 19 the registered voters of the county.  Current law establishes

  1 21 election, may institute proceedings for the issuance of bonds
  1 22 for a general county purpose by notice and publication of the

  1 24 to petition for an election, subject to the following bond

  1 30 amount of not more than $300,000.  However, if at any time

  1 32 bonds, a valid petition is filed with the county auditor asking
  1 33 that the question of issuing the bonds be submitted to the

  2  1 to have been abandoned or shall direct the county commissioner
  2  2 of elections to call a special election upon the question of
  2  3 issuing the bonds.

  2  5 the county population categories to the following amounts: (1)
  2  6 in counties having a population of 20,000 or less, in an amount
  2  7 of not more than $400,000; (2) in counties having a population
  2  8 of over 20,000 and not over 50,000, in an amount of not more
