  3 33 obligations that the maker owes on any unpaid checks are not
  3 34 delinquent and the licensee cannot charge penalties for a

  4  1 The bill requires the extended repayment plan agreement
  4  2 to be in writing, signed by the maker and the licensee, and
  4  3 contain the schedule for payment of the total unpaid check
  4  4 obligations. The schedule must allow the maker to pay the
