  9 17 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 18 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 19    In 2005, the property assessment appeal board was
  9 20 established.  The legislation establishing the property
  9 21 assessment appeal board included a future repeal of the board
  9 22 effective July 1, 2013.  This future repeal provision was
  9 23 amended in 2013 to extend the date of the repeal to July 1,
  9 24 2018. In 2015, the future repeal provision was again extended
  9 25 from July 1, 2018, to July 1, 2021.
  9 26    This bill repeals the property assessment appeal board's
  9 27 future repeal provisions, including the 2013 and 2015
  9 28 amendments to those provisions, and makes corresponding
  9 29 changes.
  9 30    The bill also modifies language regarding the form of filing
  9 31 of appeals with the property assessment appeal board by no
  9 32 longer requiring a separate notice of appeal and a petition,
  9 33 but instead only requiring the appeal to include the contents
  9 34 currently required to be in the petition.
  9 35    The bill provides that testimony given relating to an appeal
 10  1 before the board is required to be electronically recorded,
 10  2 instead of transcribed as required under current law.
 10  3    The bill strikes a provision of current law that requires any
 10  4 deliberation of the board regarding an initial determination
 10  5 to be confidential.
 10  6    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 441.38 governing
 10  7 appeals from the property assessment appeal board to district
 10  8 court and specifies that judicial review of board decisions are
 10  9 governed by Code chapter 17A (Iowa administrative procedure
 10 10 Act).  However, the bill requires petitions for judicial review
 10 11 to be filed in the county where the property subject to the
 10 12 appeal is located, without the option of filing in Polk county
 10 13 district court.
 10 14    Current law requires that tax amounts reduced due to a
 10 15 reduction in the assessment by the property assessment appeal
 10 16 board be refunded if the taxes have already been paid. The
 10 17 bill provides that the reduced amount may be refunded or
 10 18 credited against future property tax liability.
 10 19    The bill authorizes the property assessment appeal board  to
 10 20 adopt rules establishing requirements for notices of voluntary
 10 21 settlements in appeals before the board to be served upon
 10 22 affected taxing districts.
 10 23    The bill also makes corresponding changes and reorganizes
 10 24 some provisions governing the property assessment appeal board.
 10 25    The bill applies to assessment years beginning on or after
 10 26 January 1, 2018.
