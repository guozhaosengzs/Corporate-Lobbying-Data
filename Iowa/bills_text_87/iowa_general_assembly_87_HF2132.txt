  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2 feeding operations == impaired waters.
  1  3    1.  As used in this section, unless the context otherwise
  1  4 requires:
  1  5    a.  "Section 303(d) list" means the same as  defined in
  1  6 section 455B.171.
  1  7    b.  "Subwatershed" means the same as defined in section
  1  8 466B.2.
  1  9    2.  a.  A person shall not construct, including expand, a
  1 10 confinement feeding operation structure, if the confinement
  1 11 feeding operation structure would be located in a subwatershed
  1 12 that drains into a water body or water segment that has been
  1 13 placed on the department's section 303(d) list, regardless of
  1 14 whether a total maximum daily load for that water body or water
  1 15 segment has been developed.
  1 16    b.  The department shall not file or approve an application
  1 17 for a permit to construct, including expand, a confinement
  1 18 feeding operation structure, if the person could not construct
  1 19 the confinement feeding operation structure under paragraph
  1 20 "a".
  1 21    3.  Subsection 2 does not apply to prevent a person from
  1 22 constructing, including expanding, a confinement feeding
  1 23 operation structure as otherwise provided in this subchapter,
  1 24 if the confinement feeding operation structure is located in a
  1 25 subwatershed that drains into a water body or water segment,
  1 26 and the department does all of the following:
  1 27    a.  Removes the water body or water segment from the section
  1 28 303(d) list.
  1 29    b.  Determines that the water body or water segment is
  1 30 classified for a primary contact recreational use as provided
  1 31 in 567 IAC 61.3.
  1 32    4.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit a person from
  1 33 completing construction, including expansion, of a confinement
  1 34 feeding operation structure, if prior to the effective date
  1 35 of this Act, the person has begun construction, including
  2  1 expansion, of the confinement feeding operation structure as
  2  2 otherwise allowed under this chapter.
  2  3    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE UPON ENACTMENT.  This Act, being deemed of
  2  4 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  2  5                           EXPLANATION
  2  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  2  9 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in
  2 10 large part provides for the regulation of confinement feeding
  2 11 operations (operations) including associated confinement
  2 12 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings or
  2 13 manure storage structures.  The Code chapter is  regulated and
  2 14 enforced by the department of natural resources (DNR) which
  2 15 also enforces provisions of other environmental regulations
  2 16 such as the federal Clean Water Act under the supervision of
  2 17 the United States environmental protection agency (EPA).
  2 18    BILL'S PROVISIONS == MORATORIUM.  The bill prohibits the
  2 19 construction of a structure, if the structure's operation is
  2 20 located in a subwatershed that includes a water body or water
  2 21 segment that has been placed on a list of impaired waters.  The
  2 22 prohibition would no longer apply once the water was removed
  2 23 from the list and DNR determined that the water meets the state
  2 24 surface water classification for primary contact recreational
  2 25 use.
  2 26    BACKGROUND.  DNR's list of impaired waters is approved by EPA
  2 27 according to federal and state requirements (33 U.S.C. {1313
  2 28 and Code sections 455B.194 and 455B.195). DNR is also required
  2 29 to develop a plan for restoring the impaired waters, including
  2 30 by identifying its total maximum daily loads; commonly
  2 31 referred to as TMDL that calculates the amount of contaminants
  2 32 that a water body may receive and still meet federal water
  2 33 quality standards (40 C.F.R. {130.7(b)(4)).  Based on these
  2 34 measurements, the department classifies surface waters
  2 35 for a number of designated uses including primary contact
  3  1 recreational use which means that the water is considered safe
  3  2 for uses that may result in a person's prolonged and direct
  3  3 contact with the water, including by ingestion while swimming
  3  4 (33 U.S.C. {1251(a)(2) and 567 IAC 61.3).
  3  5    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different
  3  6 civil penalties apply to violations involving water quality.
  3  7 A person who violates a provision regulating water quality is
  3  8 subject to an administratively assessed civil penalty of not
  3  9 more than $10,000, or a judicially assessed amount of not more
  3 10 than $5,000 per each day of the violation (Code section 459.603
  3 11 referring to Code sections 455B.109 and 455B.191).
  3 12    EFFECTIVE DATE.  The bill, if enacted, would take effect upon
  3 13 enactment.

  2  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  2  9 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in
  2 10 large part provides for the regulation of confinement feeding
  2 11 operations (operations) including associated confinement
  2 12 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings or
  2 13 manure storage structures.  The Code chapter is  regulated and
  2 14 enforced by the department of natural resources (DNR) which
  2 15 also enforces provisions of other environmental regulations
  2 16 such as the federal Clean Water Act under the supervision of
  2 17 the United States environmental protection agency (EPA).
  2 18    BILL'S PROVISIONS == MORATORIUM.  The bill prohibits the
  2 19 construction of a structure, if the structure's operation is
  2 20 located in a subwatershed that includes a water body or water
  2 21 segment that has been placed on a list of impaired waters.  The
  2 22 prohibition would no longer apply once the water was removed
  2 23 from the list and DNR determined that the water meets the state
  2 24 surface water classification for primary contact recreational
  2 25 use.
  2 26    BACKGROUND.  DNR's list of impaired waters is approved by EPA
  2 27 according to federal and state requirements (33 U.S.C. {1313
  2 28 and Code sections 455B.194 and 455B.195). DNR is also required
  2 29 to develop a plan for restoring the impaired waters, including
  2 30 by identifying its total maximum daily loads; commonly
  2 31 referred to as TMDL that calculates the amount of contaminants
  2 32 that a water body may receive and still meet federal water
  2 33 quality standards (40 C.F.R. {130.7(b)(4)).  Based on these
  2 34 measurements, the department classifies surface waters
  2 35 for a number of designated uses including primary contact
  3  1 recreational use which means that the water is considered safe
  3  2 for uses that may result in a person's prolonged and direct
  3  3 contact with the water, including by ingestion while swimming
  3  4 (33 U.S.C. {1251(a)(2) and 567 IAC 61.3).
  3  5    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different
  3  6 civil penalties apply to violations involving water quality.
  3  7 A person who violates a provision regulating water quality is
  3  8 subject to an administratively assessed civil penalty of not
  3  9 more than $10,000, or a judicially assessed amount of not more
  3 10 than $5,000 per each day of the violation (Code section 459.603

  2  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  2  9 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in
  2 10 large part provides for the regulation of confinement feeding
  2 11 operations (operations) including associated confinement
  2 12 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings or
  2 13 manure storage structures.  The Code chapter is  regulated and
  2 14 enforced by the department of natural resources (DNR) which
  2 15 also enforces provisions of other environmental regulations
  2 16 such as the federal Clean Water Act under the supervision of
  2 17 the United States environmental protection agency (EPA).
  2 18    BILL'S PROVISIONS == MORATORIUM.  The bill prohibits the
  2 19 construction of a structure, if the structure's operation is
  2 20 located in a subwatershed that includes a water body or water
  2 21 segment that has been placed on a list of impaired waters.  The
  2 22 prohibition would no longer apply once the water was removed
  2 23 from the list and DNR determined that the water meets the state
  2 24 surface water classification for primary contact recreational
  2 25 use.
  2 26    BACKGROUND.  DNR's list of impaired waters is approved by EPA
  2 27 according to federal and state requirements (33 U.S.C. {1313
  2 28 and Code sections 455B.194 and 455B.195). DNR is also required
  2 29 to develop a plan for restoring the impaired waters, including
  2 30 by identifying its total maximum daily loads; commonly
  2 31 referred to as TMDL that calculates the amount of contaminants
  2 32 that a water body may receive and still meet federal water
  2 33 quality standards (40 C.F.R. {130.7(b)(4)).  Based on these
  2 34 measurements, the department classifies surface waters
  2 35 for a number of designated uses including primary contact
  3  1 recreational use which means that the water is considered safe
  3  2 for uses that may result in a person's prolonged and direct
  3  3 contact with the water, including by ingestion while swimming
  3  4 (33 U.S.C. {1251(a)(2) and 567 IAC 61.3).
  3  5    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different
  3  6 civil penalties apply to violations involving water quality.
  3  7 A person who violates a provision regulating water quality is
  3  8 subject to an administratively assessed civil penalty of not
  3  9 more than $10,000, or a judicially assessed amount of not more
  3 10 than $5,000 per each day of the violation (Code section 459.603

  2 20 located in a subwatershed that includes a water body or water
  2 21 segment that has been placed on a list of impaired waters.  The
  2 22 prohibition would no longer apply once the water was removed
  2 23 from the list and DNR determined that the water meets the state
  2 24 surface water classification for primary contact recreational
  2 25 use.
  2 26    BACKGROUND.  DNR's list of impaired waters is approved by EPA
  2 27 according to federal and state requirements (33 U.S.C. {1313
  2 28 and Code sections 455B.194 and 455B.195). DNR is also required
  2 29 to develop a plan for restoring the impaired waters, including
  2 30 by identifying its total maximum daily loads; commonly
  2 31 referred to as TMDL that calculates the amount of contaminants
  2 32 that a water body may receive and still meet federal water
  2 33 quality standards (40 C.F.R. {130.7(b)(4)).  Based on these
  2 34 measurements, the department classifies surface waters
  2 35 for a number of designated uses including primary contact
  3  1 recreational use which means that the water is considered safe
  3  2 for uses that may result in a person's prolonged and direct
  3  3 contact with the water, including by ingestion while swimming
  3  4 (33 U.S.C. {1251(a)(2) and 567 IAC 61.3).
  3  5    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different
  3  6 civil penalties apply to violations involving water quality.
  3  7 A person who violates a provision regulating water quality is
  3  8 subject to an administratively assessed civil penalty of not
  3  9 more than $10,000, or a judicially assessed amount of not more
  3 10 than $5,000 per each day of the violation (Code section 459.603
  3 11 referring to Code sections 455B.109 and 455B.191).

  2 18    BILL'S PROVISIONS == MORATORIUM.  The bill prohibits the
  2 19 construction of a structure, if the structure's operation is
  2 20 located in a subwatershed that includes a water body or water
  2 21 segment that has been placed on a list of impaired waters.  The
  2 22 prohibition would no longer apply once the water was removed
  2 23 from the list and DNR determined that the water meets the state
  2 24 surface water classification for primary contact recreational
  2 25 use.
  2 26    BACKGROUND.  DNR's list of impaired waters is approved by EPA
  2 27 according to federal and state requirements (33 U.S.C. {1313
  2 28 and Code sections 455B.194 and 455B.195). DNR is also required
  2 29 to develop a plan for restoring the impaired waters, including
  2 30 by identifying its total maximum daily loads; commonly
  2 31 referred to as TMDL that calculates the amount of contaminants
  2 32 that a water body may receive and still meet federal water
  2 33 quality standards (40 C.F.R. {130.7(b)(4)).  Based on these
  2 34 measurements, the department classifies surface waters
  2 35 for a number of designated uses including primary contact
  3  1 recreational use which means that the water is considered safe
  3  2 for uses that may result in a person's prolonged and direct
  3  3 contact with the water, including by ingestion while swimming
  3  4 (33 U.S.C. {1251(a)(2) and 567 IAC 61.3).
  3  5    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different
  3  6 civil penalties apply to violations involving water quality.
  3  7 A person who violates a provision regulating water quality is
  3  8 subject to an administratively assessed civil penalty of not
  3  9 more than $10,000, or a judicially assessed amount of not more
  3 10 than $5,000 per each day of the violation (Code section 459.603
  3 11 referring to Code sections 455B.109 and 455B.191).

  2  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  2  9 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in
  2 10 large part provides for the regulation of confinement feeding
  2 11 operations (operations) including associated confinement
  2 12 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings or
  2 13 manure storage structures.  The Code chapter is  regulated and
  2 14 enforced by the department of natural resources (DNR) which
  2 15 also enforces provisions of other environmental regulations
  2 16 such as the federal Clean Water Act under the supervision of
  2 17 the United States environmental protection agency (EPA).
  2 18    BILL'S PROVISIONS == MORATORIUM.  The bill prohibits the
  2 19 construction of a structure, if the structure's operation is
  2 20 located in a subwatershed that includes a water body or water
  2 21 segment that has been placed on a list of impaired waters.  The
  2 22 prohibition would no longer apply once the water was removed
  2 23 from the list and DNR determined that the water meets the state
  2 24 surface water classification for primary contact recreational
  2 25 use.
  2 26    BACKGROUND.  DNR's list of impaired waters is approved by EPA
  2 27 according to federal and state requirements (33 U.S.C. {1313
  2 28 and Code sections 455B.194 and 455B.195). DNR is also required
  2 29 to develop a plan for restoring the impaired waters, including
  2 30 by identifying its total maximum daily loads; commonly
  2 31 referred to as TMDL that calculates the amount of contaminants
  2 32 that a water body may receive and still meet federal water
  2 33 quality standards (40 C.F.R. {130.7(b)(4)).  Based on these
  2 34 measurements, the department classifies surface waters
  2 35 for a number of designated uses including primary contact
  3  1 recreational use which means that the water is considered safe
  3  2 for uses that may result in a person's prolonged and direct
  3  3 contact with the water, including by ingestion while swimming
  3  4 (33 U.S.C. {1251(a)(2) and 567 IAC 61.3).
  3  5    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different
  3  6 civil penalties apply to violations involving water quality.
  3  7 A person who violates a provision regulating water quality is
  3  8 subject to an administratively assessed civil penalty of not
  3  9 more than $10,000, or a judicially assessed amount of not more
  3 10 than $5,000 per each day of the violation (Code section 459.603

  2  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS == GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  2  9 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which in
  2 10 large part provides for the regulation of confinement feeding
  2 11 operations (operations) including associated confinement
  2 12 feeding operation structures (structures) such as buildings or
  2 13 manure storage structures.  The Code chapter is  regulated and
  2 14 enforced by the department of natural resources (DNR) which
  2 15 also enforces provisions of other environmental regulations
  2 16 such as the federal Clean Water Act under the supervision of
  2 17 the United States environmental protection agency (EPA).
  2 18    BILL'S PROVISIONS == MORATORIUM.  The bill prohibits the
  2 19 construction of a structure, if the structure's operation is
  2 20 located in a subwatershed that includes a water body or water
  2 21 segment that has been placed on a list of impaired waters.  The
  2 22 prohibition would no longer apply once the water was removed
  2 23 from the list and DNR determined that the water meets the state
  2 24 surface water classification for primary contact recreational
  2 25 use.
  2 26    BACKGROUND.  DNR's list of impaired waters is approved by EPA
  2 27 according to federal and state requirements (33 U.S.C. {1313
  2 28 and Code sections 455B.194 and 455B.195). DNR is also required
  2 29 to develop a plan for restoring the impaired waters, including
  2 30 by identifying its total maximum daily loads; commonly
  2 31 referred to as TMDL that calculates the amount of contaminants
  2 32 that a water body may receive and still meet federal water
  2 33 quality standards (40 C.F.R. {130.7(b)(4)).  Based on these
  2 34 measurements, the department classifies surface waters
  2 35 for a number of designated uses including primary contact
  3  1 recreational use which means that the water is considered safe
  3  2 for uses that may result in a person's prolonged and direct
  3  3 contact with the water, including by ingestion while swimming
  3  4 (33 U.S.C. {1251(a)(2) and 567 IAC 61.3).
  3  5    APPLICABLE PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different
  3  6 civil penalties apply to violations involving water quality.
  3  7 A person who violates a provision regulating water quality is
  3  8 subject to an administratively assessed civil penalty of not
  3  9 more than $10,000, or a judicially assessed amount of not more
  3 10 than $5,000 per each day of the violation (Code section 459.603
