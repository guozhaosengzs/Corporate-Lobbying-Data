Article
I
——
Findings
and
declaration
of
purpose.
4


a.
The
party
states
find
all
of
the
following:
5


(1)
The
health
and
safety
of
the
public
are
affected
by
the
6


degree
of
compliance
with
advanced
practice
registered
nurse
7


licensure
requirements
and
the
effectiveness
of
enforcement
8


activities
related
to
state
advanced
practice
registered
nurse
9


licensure
laws.
10


(2)
Violations
of
advanced
practice
registered
nurse
11


licensure
and
other
laws
regulating
the
practice
of
nursing
may
12


result
in
injury
or
harm
to
the
public.
13


(3)
The
expanded
mobility
of
advanced
practice
registered
14


nurses
and
the
use
of
advanced
communication
technologies
15


as
part
of
our
nation’s
health
care
delivery
system
require
16


greater
coordination
and
cooperation
among
states
in
the
areas
17


of
advanced
practice
registered
nurse
licensure
and
regulation.
18


(4)
New
practice
modalities
and
technology
make
compliance
19


with
individual
state
advanced
practice
registered
nurse
20


licensure
laws
difficult
and
complex.
21


(5)
The

system
of
duplicative
advanced
practice
22


registered
nurse
licensure
for
advanced
practice
registered
23


nurses
practicing
in
multiple
states
is
cumbersome
and
24


redundant
for
both
advanced
practice
registered
nurses
and
25


states.
26


(6)
Uniformity
of
advanced
practice
registered
nurse
27


licensure
requirements
throughout
the
states
promotes
public
28


safety
and
public
health
benefits.
29


b.
The
general
purposes
of
this
compact
are
to:
