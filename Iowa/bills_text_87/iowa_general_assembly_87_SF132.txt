  1 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 17    This bill relates to special exceptions and variances from
  1 18 city zoning regulations.
  1 19    Under current law, a city's zoning board of adjustment is
  1 20 granted the power to hear and decide special exceptions to
  1 21 city zoning regulations. The bill provides that the board
  1 22 of adjustment is granted such powers unless procedures are
  1 23 otherwise provided by the city council by ordinance.
  1 24    Current law also allows the board of adjustment to authorize
  1 25 a variance from zoning regulations not contrary to the public
  1 26 interest if, based upon special conditions, literal enforcement
  1 27 of the provisions of the zoning regulations will result in
  1 28 unnecessary hardship.  The bill allows the granting of a
  1 29 variance if literal enforcement of the provisions of the
  1 30 ordinance will result in practical difficulty, rather than
  1 31 unnecessary hardship.
