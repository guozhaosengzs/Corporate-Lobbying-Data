EXPLANATION
7


The
inclusion

this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
8


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.

GENERAL.
This
bill
extends
the
beginning
farmer
tax
credit
10


program
established
in
2013
which
allows
taxpayers
holding
11


agricultural
land
used
for
farming
to
claim
two
types
of
income
12


tax
credits:
(1)
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
13


and
(2)
the
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit.
The
program
14


is
due
to
expire
on
January
1,
2018,
and
the
bill
extends
that
15


date
five
years
to
January
1,
2023.
On
that
same
date,
a
16


former
version
of
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
17


as
it
existed
immediately
prior
to
2013
is
restored
with
one
18


exception.
The
former
version
would
incorporate
a
change
made
19


in
the
2013
legislation
which
increased
the
carryforward
period
20


from
five
to
10
years.
When
the
program
is
eliminated
and
the
21


former
version
of
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
22


is
restored,
the
available
standing
appropriation
used
to
23


support
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
is
restored
24


to
the
pre-2013
amount
of
$6
million,
a
reduction
from
$12
25


million
currently
available
to
support
both
tax
credits.
26


BACKGROUND
——
PROGRAM.
A
taxpayer
who
holds
agricultural
27


land
which
may
include
other
assets
(such
as
depreciable
28


agricultural
property,
crops,
or
livestock),
and
who
executes
29


an
agreement
with
a
beginning
farmer
is
entitled
to
claim
a
30


tax
credit
against
individual
or
corporate
tax
liability
(Code
31


section
16.80).
The
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
32


is
available
to
a
taxpayer
who
assists
a
beginning
farmer
in
33


acquiring
agricultural
assets
(land
by
lease
or
equipment
by
34


rental
agreement).
The
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit
35


-3-

H.F.
_____


is
available
to
a
taxpayer
who
enters
into
a
contract
with
1


a
beginning
farmer
to
perform
custom
work
on
agricultural
2


land
held
by
the
taxpayer
(Code
section
16.81).
Generally,
3


$8
million
of
the
appropriated
$12
million
is
allocated
to
4


support
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
and
the
5


remaining
$4
million
is
allocated
to
support
the
custom
farming
6


contract
tax
credit
(Code
section
16.82).
For
the
agricultural
7


assets
transfer
tax
credit,
the
tax
credit
percentages
for
cash
8


rent
and
crop
share
agreements
are
7
percent
and
17
percent,
9


respectively,
with
an
additional
1
percent
bonus
provided
for
10


the
first
year
of
the
agreement
if
the
beginning
farmer
is
11


a
veteran.
Once
the
former
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
12


credit
is
restored,
the
tax
credit
percentages
are
reduced
to
5
13


and
15
percent,
respectively,
and
without
a
veteran
bonus.
For
14


a
custom
farming
contract
tax
credit,
the
tax
credit
percentage
15


equals
7
percent
of
the
value
of
the
contract
on
a
tax
credit
16


with
an
additional
1
percent
bonus
provided
if
the
beginning
17


farmer
is
a
veteran.
A
taxpayer
cannot
claim
a
tax
credit
in
18


excess
of
$50,000
under
either
program.
The
restored
version
19


of
the
agricultural
assets
transfer
tax
credit
does
not
limit
20


the
amount
that
a
taxpayer
may
claim.
21


BACKGROUND
——
ADMINISTRATION.
In
2013
and
2014,
supervision
22


of
the
program
was
transferred
from
the
Iowa
agricultural
23


development
authority
to
the
Iowa
finance
authority
and
the
24


relevant
statutory
provisions
were
transferred
from
Code
25


chapter
175
to
Code
chapter
16
(2013
Iowa
Acts,
ch.
100,
and
26


2014
Iowa
Acts,
ch.
1080).
