  2  2    This bill amends the Iowa civil rights Act of 1965 contained
  2  3 in Code chapter 216. Code sections 216.7 and 216.9 relate to
  2  4 unfair practices regarding access to public accommodations
  2  5 and educational institutions. Current law allows a bona fide
  2  6 religious institution to impose qualifications for access to
  2  7 such accommodations and educational institutions when such
  2  8 qualifications are related to a bona fide religious purpose.
  2  9 The bill removes the requirement that the qualifications be
  2 10 related to a bona fide religious purpose.
  2 11    The bill excludes an action to refuse or deny access to a
  2 12 toilet facility, locker room, living facility, or other area
  2 13 of a public accommodation designated for use by persons of one
  2 14 sex to a person of the other sex from the activities which
  2 15 constitute unfair or discriminatory practices by a public
  2 16 accommodation under Code chapter 216.
  2 17    The bill also provides that an educational institution
  2 18 is not required to allow access to toilet facilities, locker
  2 19 rooms, or living facilities designated for use by persons of
  2 20 one sex to a person of the other sex and provides that the civil
