  8  1 A registered voter who has signed two oaths on election day
  8  2 attesting to a person's identity and residency as provided in
  8  3 this subsection is prohibited from signing any further oaths as
  8  4 provided in this subsection on that day.

 15 13    Sec. 27.   15 13    Sec. 27.   15 14    1.  After each general election, the state commissioner
 15 15 shall, with the cooperation of the county commissioners,
 15 16 conduct an audit of the official canvass of votes from the
 15 17 preceding general election.
 15 18    2.  The state commissioner shall determine the number of
 15 19 counties and precincts to be audited and shall select the
 15 20 precincts to be audited by lot. The absentee ballot and
 15 21 special voters precinct for each county, established pursuant
 15 22 to section 53.20, shall be included with all other precincts of
 15 23 the county for selection by lot. In every precinct selected,
 15 24 the commissioner shall conduct a hand count of all ballots cast
 15 25 in the preceding general election for president of the United
 15 26 States or governor, as the case may be. The hand count shall
 15 27 be observed by a representative selected by each of the two
 15 28 political parties whose candidates received the highest number
 15 29 of votes statewide in the preceding general election.
 15 30    3.  a.  The commissioner may order an administrative recount

 15 32 results of an audit require an administrative recount.
 15 33    b.  If selected to conduct an audit, the commissioner shall

 16  2    4.  The results of an audit conducted pursuant to this

 16  4 certification, of an election.
 16  5    5.  In advance of any other election, the state commissioner
 16  6 may order an audit of the election in the manner provided in
 16  7 this section.
 16  8    6.  The state commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to
 16  9 chapter 17A, to implement this section.
 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 15 18    2.  The state commissioner shall determine the number of
 15 19 counties and precincts to be audited and shall select the
 15 20 precincts to be audited by lot. The absentee ballot and
 15 21 special voters precinct for each county, established pursuant
 15 22 to section 53.20, shall be included with all other precincts of
 15 23 the county for selection by lot. In every precinct selected,
 15 24 the commissioner shall conduct a hand count of all ballots cast
 15 25 in the preceding general election for president of the United
 15 26 States or governor, as the case may be. The hand count shall
 15 27 be observed by a representative selected by each of the two
 15 28 political parties whose candidates received the highest number
 15 29 of votes statewide in the preceding general election.
 15 30    3.  a.  The commissioner may order an administrative recount
 15 31 pursuant to section 50.50 if the commissioner determines the
 15 32 results of an audit require an administrative recount.
 15 33    b.  If selected to conduct an audit, the commissioner shall
 15 34 provide an audit report to the county board of supervisors and

 16  9 chapter 17A, to implement this section.
 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and

 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 15 18    2.  The state commissioner shall determine the number of
 15 19 counties and precincts to be audited and shall select the
 15 20 precincts to be audited by lot. The absentee ballot and
 15 21 special voters precinct for each county, established pursuant
 15 22 to section 53.20, shall be included with all other precincts of
 15 23 the county for selection by lot. In every precinct selected,
 15 24 the commissioner shall conduct a hand count of all ballots cast
 15 25 in the preceding general election for president of the United
 15 26 States or governor, as the case may be. The hand count shall
 15 27 be observed by a representative selected by each of the two
 15 28 political parties whose candidates received the highest number
 15 29 of votes statewide in the preceding general election.
 15 30    3.  a.  The commissioner may order an administrative recount
 15 31 pursuant to section 50.50 if the commissioner determines the
 15 32 results of an audit require an administrative recount.
 15 33    b.  If selected to conduct an audit, the commissioner shall
 15 34 provide an audit report to the county board of supervisors and

 16  9 chapter 17A, to implement this section.
 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections

 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and

 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with

 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form

 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 15 25 in the preceding general election for president of the United
 15 26 States or governor, as the case may be. The hand count shall
 15 27 be observed by a representative selected by each of the two
 15 28 political parties whose candidates received the highest number
 15 29 of votes statewide in the preceding general election.
 15 30    3.  a.  The commissioner may order an administrative recount
 15 31 pursuant to section 50.50 if the commissioner determines the

 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The

 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

       aw/sc
 15 24 the commissioner shall conduct a hand count of all ballots cast
 15 25 in the preceding general election for president of the United
 15 26 States or governor, as the case may be. The hand count shall
 15 27 be observed by a representative selected by each of the two
 15 28 political parties whose candidates received the highest number
 15 29 of votes statewide in the preceding general election.
 15 30    3.  a.  The commissioner may order an administrative recount

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to

 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The

 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the

 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 15 33    b.  If selected to conduct an audit, the commissioner shall
 15 34 provide an audit report to the county board of supervisors and
 15 35 shall transmit the audit report to the state commissioner no

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on

 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an

 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or

 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with

 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 15 35 shall transmit the audit report to the state commissioner no
 16  1 later than twenty days following the election.

 16  6 may order an audit of the election in the manner provided in
 16  7 this section.
 16  8    6.  The state commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an

 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16  3 section shall not change the results, or invalidate the
 16  4 certification, of an election.
 16  5    5.  In advance of any other election, the state commissioner
 16  6 may order an audit of the election in the manner provided in
 16  7 this section.
 16  8    6.  The state commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to
 16  9 chapter 17A, to implement this section.
 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections

 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the

 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a

 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the

 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16  3 section shall not change the results, or invalidate the
 16  4 certification, of an election.
 16  5    5.  In advance of any other election, the state commissioner
 16  6 may order an audit of the election in the manner provided in
 16  7 this section.
 16  8    6.  The state commissioner shall adopt rules, pursuant to
 16  9 chapter 17A, to implement this section.
 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the

 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.

 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and

 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject

 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a

 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another

 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16  9 chapter 17A, to implement this section.
 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16  9 chapter 17A, to implement this section.
 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill

 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another

 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of

 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The

 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and

 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 10                           EXPLANATION
 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The

 16 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 16 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 16 13    This bill relates to the conduct and administration of
 16 14 elections, including voter registration, absentee voting,
 16 15 voter identity and signature verification, polling place
 16 16 prohibitions, county commissioner of elections certifications,
 16 17 post=election audits, and creation of an electronic poll book
 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The

 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and

 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill

 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.

 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section

 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 18 program and revolving loan fund.
 16 19    Division I of the bill relates to the conduct and
 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the

 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the

 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 20 administration of elections generally. The bill requires a
 16 21 person, while acting on behalf of a political party, a nonparty
 16 22 political organization, or a candidate or committee subject
 16 23 to Iowa's campaign finance laws, who accepts a completed
 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.

 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase

 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select

 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to

 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate

 16 24 voter registration form from an applicant to submit the form
 16 25 to the appropriate county commissioner of elections (county
 16 26 auditor) within seven days of receiving the form. The bill
 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate

 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter

 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 27 also provides that if the person accepts a completed voter
 16 28 registration form within three days of a voter registration
 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the

 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to

 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate

 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65

 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the

 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state

 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and

 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required

 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear

 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the

 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the

 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 29 deadline, the person must submit the form to the appropriate
 16 30 commissioner within 24 hours of accepting the form, and not
 16 31 later than the registration deadline for the next election.
 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by

 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state

 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 16 32 By operation of current law, failure to timely submit such a
 16 33 form would constitute a simple misdemeanor. The bill also
 16 34 makes it a simple misdemeanor to violate any provision of Code
 16 35 chapter 48A, related to voter registration, for which another
 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.

 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to

 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.

 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the

 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 17  1 penalty is not provided. A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 17  2 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 17  3 but not more than $625 or by both.
 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and

 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with

 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the

 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.

 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate
 22  3 the certification, of an election.

 17  4    Division I requires county commissioners to cancel the voter
 17  5 registration of a registered voter if the registered voter
 17  6 is not a resident of Iowa or submits jury service=related
 17  7 documentation that indicates that the voter is not a citizen of
 17  8 the United States.
 17  9    Division I of the bill also requires the state registrar of
 17 10 vital statistics to produce and transmit certain lists to the
 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the
 18  2 deadline.
 18  3    Division I prohibits a voter from voting or offering to vote
 18  4 a ballot in the commissioner's office that was not furnished to
 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.
 20 10    Division II of the bill takes effect contingent on an
 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by

 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and

 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to

 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and

 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and

 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.

 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a

 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides

 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to

 17 11 state registrar of voters (secretary of state) without charge.
 17 12    Division I changes the time period to apply for an absentee
 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied

 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and

 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by

 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate

 17 13 ballot from not more than 70 days before the election to not
 17 14 more than 120 days before the election. The bill further
 17 15 provides that an application received more than 120 days
 17 16 before the election shall be returned to the applicant along
 17 17 with notification of when the applications will be accepted.
 17 18 Current law requires the commissioner to retain the application
 17 19 and process it with other applications received within the
 17 20 appropriate time period.
 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section
 17 34 48A.9, which is either 11 or 10 days before the election.
 17 35 The bill establishes additional duties for actual or implied
 18  1 agents of political parties for applications received after the

 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and

 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear

 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional

 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including

 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that

 17 21    Division I requires that an application for an absentee
 17 22 ballot by any applicant other than a person requesting an
 17 23 absentee ballot pursuant to Code section 53.22 contain the
 17 24 applicant's voter verification number, defined in the bill
 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section

 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear

 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to

 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans

 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include

 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to

 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with

 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a

 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the

 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the

 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to

 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The

 17 25 as the voter's identification number assigned by the state
 17 26 commissioner, driver's license number, or nonoperator's
 17 27 identification card number. Under the bill, a person's
 17 28 voter identification number, driver's license number, or
 17 29 nonoperator's identification number is considered to be a voter
 17 30 verification number, which is required to be kept confidential.
 17 31 The bill also changes the absentee ballot application deadline
 17 32 from the Friday before the election to the same deadline as
 17 33 voter registration for a given election under Code section

 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and

 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear

 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans

 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include

 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides

 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear

 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the

 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include

 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including

 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.

 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections

 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the

 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the

 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and

 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides

 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to

 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30

 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the

 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.

 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the

 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the

 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides

 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the

 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with

 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A

 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the

 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and

 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and

 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear

 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans

 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the

 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include

 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the

 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to

 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the

 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and

 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to

 18  5 the voter by the commissioner. The bill also prohibits a voter
 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general

 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner

 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.

 18  6 from taking or removing any ballot from the commissioner's
 18  7 office. Current law expressly prohibits these actions at
 18  8 precinct polling places.
 18  9    Division II of the bill relates to identity and signature
 18 10 verification for certain voter registrants and voters. The
 18 11 bill changes the requirements for establishing identity and
 18 12 residence for persons registering to vote in=person absentee or
 18 13 on election day by adding veterans identification cards issued
 18 14 by the United States to the list of acceptable photographic
 18 15 identification for establishing identity.
 18 16    Division II of the bill requires the state registrar of
 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by
 20 14 creating an electronic poll book and polling place technology
 20 15 program and revolving loan fund and by regulating the use of
 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The

 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include

 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including

 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the

 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling

 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and

 18 17 voters to compare lists of voters who registered to vote during
 18 18 the preceding week with the department of transportation's
 18 19 driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
 18 20 files. Under the bill, the state registrar is required
 18 21 to issue a free voter verification card, including a voter
 18 22 identification number, to be used only for voting and voter
 18 23 registration purposes, to registrants whose names do not appear
 18 24 in the department's files. Under the bill, providing voter
 18 25 verification cards is contingent upon adequate appropriations.
 18 26    Division II of the bill also requires election officials
 18 27 to verify a voter's identity before furnishing a ballot
 18 28 to the voter. A voter at the polling place is required to
 18 29 present the official with a voter verification card, an Iowa
 18 30 driver's license, an Iowa nonoperator's identification card, a
 18 31 United States passport, a United States military or veterans
 18 32 identification card, or a voter acknowledgment card issued by
 18 33 the county commissioner in order to verify the voter's identity
 18 34 before the voter can receive a ballot. Under the bill, a voter
 18 35 may also present the forms of identification required for
 19  1 election day and in=person absentee voter registration or have
 19  2 their identity and residency attested to by another registered
 19  3 voter in order to verify the voter's identity. Under the bill,
 19  4 a registered voter is allowed to attest to the identity and
 19  5 residency of not more than two other voters on election day.
 19  6 If the voter fails to establish the voter's identity by the
 19  7 methods provided in the bill, the voter may vote a provisional
 19  8 ballot. A voter may also vote a ballot as otherwise provided
 19  9 for under current law by signing an oath attesting to the
 19 10 voter's identity at any election conducted prior to January 1,
 19 11 2019.
 19 12    The bill also requires that county commissioners include
 19 13 information on the verification of voter identities in the
 19 14 notice of each election published under Code section 49.53.
 19 15    Division II requires precinct election officials to examine
 19 16 a voter's identification to determine whether the person
 19 17 offering to vote matches the identification card, including
 19 18 the voter's signature. The bill requires an election official
 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots
 19 24 pursuant to Code section 53.22.
 19 25    Related to absentee voting, division II of the bill provides
 19 26 that a county commissioner may dispute certain applications
 19 27 for an absentee ballot if it appears to the commissioner that
 19 28 the signature on the application has been signed by someone
 19 29 other than the registered voter, in comparing the signature on
 19 30 the application to the signature on record of the registered
 19 31 voter named on the application. If the commissioner disputes
 19 32 a registered voter's application under this subsection, the
 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature
 20  1 on record. The bill also requires county commissioners to
 20  2 consider absentee ballots to be defective if it appears to
 20  3 the commissioner that the signature on the envelope marked
 20  4 with the affidavit has been signed by someone other than the
 20  5 registered voter, in comparing the signature on the envelope to
 20  6 the signature on record of the registered voter named on the
 20  7 envelope.
 20  8    Under the bill, the provisions of division II and their
 20  9 application are severable.

 20 11 appropriation and applies to elections held on or after the
 20 12 effective date of division II.
 20 13    Division III of the bill relates to polling places by

 20 16 photographic devices and the display of voted ballots.
 20 17    Division III creates an electronic poll book and polling
 20 18 place technology program and revolving loan fund in the state
 20 19 treasury. Under the bill, the state commissioner of elections
 20 20 (secretary of state) is required to administer the fund.
 20 21 Moneys in the fund may include moneys allocated from the state
 20 22 commissioner's budget and any other moneys obtained or accepted
 20 23 by the state commissioner for deposit in the revolving loan
 20 24 fund. The state commissioner is allowed to loan moneys in
 20 25 the revolving loan fund to county commissioners to purchase
 20 26 or update electronic poll book and polling place technology.
 20 27 Under the bill, the state commissioner is allowed to spend 30
 20 28 percent of the moneys in the revolving loan fund to administer
 20 29 polling place technology.
 20 30    Division III also provides that interest or earnings on
 20 31 moneys in the revolving loan fund are credited to the fund and
 20 32 moneys in the revolving loan fund that remain unencumbered or
 20 33 unobligated at the close of a fiscal year remain available in
 20 34 the revolving loan fund.
 20 35    Division III strikes a provision of current law that
 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
 21  4 display of voted ballots is prohibited if that use or display
 21  5 is for purposes of election misconduct, interferes with other
 21  6 voters, or interferes with the orderly operation of the polling
 21  7 place.
 21  8    Division IV of the bill requires each county commissioner to
 21  9 place on file in the commissioner's office a certification that
 21 10 the county met voting equipment testing, election personnel
 21 11 training, polling place accessibility, publications, and
 21 12 certain administrative rule requirements at each general
 21 13 election. The certification is also required to include a
 21 14 copy of the results of election audits if the commissioner is
 21 15 required to conduct an audit, described in division IV of the
 21 16 bill.  If the commissioner is not required to conduct an audit,
 21 17 the commissioner is required to include the certification with
 21 18 the election canvass summary report. The county commissioner
 21 19 is also required to file a copy of the certification with
 21 20 the state commissioner. The bill further requires the
 21 21 commissioner to promptly notify the state commissioner of
 21 22 each suspected incidence of election misconduct that the
 21 23 commissioner has referred to other agencies or law enforcement
 21 24 for investigation.
 21 25    Division IV of the bill also requires the state commissioner
 21 26 to complete a post=election audit of each general election.
 21 27 The bill requires the state commissioner to determine the
 21 28 number of counties and precincts to be audited and to select
 21 29 precincts to be audited in a county, by lot. The audit is
 21 30 required to be a hand count of ballots for the office of
 21 31 president of the United States or governor, as the case may
 21 32 be. Under the bill, a county commissioner is allowed to
 21 33 order an administrative recount under certain conditions. A
 21 34 county commissioner selected to conduct an audit is required
 21 35 to provide an audit report to the board of supervisors and
 22  1 the state commissioner, as provided for under the bill. The
 22  2 results of an audit shall not change the results, or invalidate

 19 19 to challenge a person offering to vote if the person's
 19 20 identification does not appear to be the person offering to
 19 21 vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn, the voter may vote a
 19 22 provisional ballot. The proof of identity requirements under
 19 23 the bill shall not apply to persons voting absentee ballots

 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature

 19 33 commissioner is required to notify the registered voter and
 19 34 the registered voter is permitted to submit a new application
 19 35 and signature or update the registered voter's signature

 21  1 prohibits the use of all cameras, cellular telephones, pagers,
 21  2 or other electronic communications devices in a voting booth
 21  3 and provides that the use of photographic devices and the
