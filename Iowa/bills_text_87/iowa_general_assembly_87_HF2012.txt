  1 27    Under current law, Code section 321J.10 allows the issuance
  1 28 of a search warrant for the withdrawal of a specimen of breath,
  1 29 urine, or blood for chemical testing based upon sworn oral
  1 30 testimony communicated by telephone to a magistrate in cases
  1 31 involving a traffic accident resulting in a death, or personal
  1 32 injury reasonably likely to cause death, where there are
  1 33 reasonable grounds to believe the person whose driving may have
  1 34 been the proximate cause of the accident was operating the
  1 35 vehicle while intoxicated.
  2  1 This bill expands the provision to allow the issuance of such
  2  2 a search warrant in any case where there are reasonable grounds
  2  3 to believe a person was operating a vehicle while intoxicated.
  2  4    Under current law, the act of knowingly resisting or
  2  5 obstructing the withdrawal of a specimen pursuant to a
  2  6 search warrant issued under Code section 321J.10 constitutes
  2  7 a contempt punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or
