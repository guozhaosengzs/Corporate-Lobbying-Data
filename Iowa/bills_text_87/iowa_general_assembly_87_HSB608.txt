including
animal
abandonment

section

and
3


animal
endangerment

each
of

offenses
includes
an
enhanced
penalty
that
5


applies
to
a
convicted
person
who
has
previously
committed
any
6

10


TYPES
OF
CRIMINAL
OFFENSES
——
ABUSE.
Animal
abuse
involves
11


intentionally
injuring
an
animal
by
violence
or
poisoning.
The
12


bill
replaces
the
intent
element
with
that
of
acting
knowingly
13


or
recklessly.
It
also
removes
a
provision
that
exempted
14


a
person
who
acted
with
the
consent
of
the
animal’s
owner.
15


The
bill
reduces
the
penalty
from
an
aggravated
to
a
serious
16


misdemeanor
for
committing
animal
abuse
that
does
not
cause
17


an
animal
serious
injury
or
death
and
retains
the
penalty
of
18


aggravated
misdemeanor
for
committing
animal
abuse
that
causes
19


an
animal
serious
injury
or
death.
The
bill
provides
that
the
20


aggravated
misdemeanor
may
be
enhanced
to
a
class
“D”
felony
21


if
the
person
was
previously
convicted
of
one
of
the
named
22


offenses.
23


TYPES
OF
CRIMINAL
OFFENSES
——
NEGLECT.
Animal
neglect
24


involves
failing
to
provide
an
animal
with
adequate
food,
25


water,
or
shelter,
or
torturing
the
animal.
The
bill
rewrites
26


these
requirements
by
requiring
that
an
animal
be
furnished
27


with
adequate
supplies
of
nutritional
food,
access
to
potable
28


water,
adequate
sanitary
conditions,
ventilated
shelter
29


sufficient
to
provide
the
animal
with
protection
from
extreme
30


weather
conditions,
and
necessary
veterinary
care.
The
bill
31


eliminates
the
torture
prohibition.
The
bill
retains
the
32


criminal
penalty
which
is
a
simple
misdemeanor.
However,
the
33


penalty
is
increased
to
a
serious
misdemeanor
if
the
animal
34


suffers
an
injury
and

the
aggravated
2


misdemeanor
may
be
enhanced
to
a

“D”

if
the
person
3


was
previously
convicted
of
one
of
the
named
offenses.
4


TYPES
OF
CRIMINAL
OFFENSES
——
TORTURE.
Animal
torture
5


involves
inflicting
upon
an
animal
severe
physical
pain
with
6


depraved
or
sadistic
intent
to
cause
prolonged
suffering
or
7


death.
The
bill
eliminates
the
element
of
intent
and
requires
8


that
the
act
involve
prolonged
or
repeated
physical
pain
that
9


results
in
prolonged
suffering
and
serious
injury
or
death.
10


The
bill
replaces
the
current
penalties
for
animal
torture.
A
11


person
is
no
longer
guilty
of
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
for
12


the
first
offense
and
a
class
“D”
felony
for
a
subsequent
13


offense.
Instead,
a
person
is
guilty
of
a
class
“D”
felony,
14


which
is
enhanced
to
a
class
“C”
felony
if
the
person
was
15


previously
convicted
of
one
of
the
named
offenses.
The
bill
16


also
eliminates
a
requirement
that
a
person
convicted
of
animal
17


torture
must
submit
to
psychological
evaluation
and
treatment.
18


TYPES
OF
CRIMINAL
OFFENSES
——
ABANDONMENT.
Animal
19


abandonment
involves
knowingly
or
recklessly
relinquishing
20


custody
of
an
animal
at
a
location
in
which
the
person
does
21


not
hold

interest.
There
are
exceptions
22


in
cases
of
transferring
ownership
or
custody
or
making
23


arrangements
for
the
care
of
the
animal.
The
criminal
penalty
24


is
a
simple
misdemeanor.
However,
the
penalty
is
increased
to
25


a
serious
misdemeanor
if
the
animal
suffers
an
injury
and
to
an
26


aggravated
misdemeanor
if
the

In
a

where
the

28

the
aggravated
