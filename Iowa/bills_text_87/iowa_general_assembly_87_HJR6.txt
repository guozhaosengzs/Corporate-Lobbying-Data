  4 13                           EXPLANATION
  4 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 16    This joint resolution proposes two amendments to the
  4 17 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to the appointment
  4 18 and jurisdiction of judicial officers.
  4 19    Currently, the Iowa constitution is silent regarding the
  4 20 nomination and appointment of judges of the court of appeals.
  4 21 The first amendment in the resolution constitutionally
  4 22 establishes the minimum number of court of appeals judges at
  4 23 three judges, which is consistent with the minimum number of
  4 24 constitutionally required justices of the supreme court. The
  4 25 resolution also allows the general assembly to increase or
  4 26 decrease the number of court of appeals judges from the current
  4 27 nine judges who sit on the court of appeals.
  4 28    The resolution provides that the court of appeals shall
  4 29 have appellate jurisdiction only in cases of chancery and
  4 30 shall constitute a court for the correction of errors at law,
  4 31 under such restrictions as the general assembly may, by law,
  4 32 prescribe.  The resolution also specifies that the court of
  4 33 appeals is an inferior tribunal to the supreme court.
  4 34    The resolution provides that the judges of the court of
  4 35 appeals shall be conservators of peace throughout the state.
  5  1 The resolution establishes the term of a judge of the court
  5  2 of appeals at six years.  The term of six years is consistent
  5  3 with the existing statutory law under Code section 46.16.
  5  4    The resolution specifies that a court of appeals judge is
  5  5 eligible to receive a salary from the state which is consistent
  5  6 with other salary language applicable to a supreme court
  5  7 justice or district judge.  The resolution specifies that a
  5  8 court of appeals judge is ineligible for any other office
  5  9 of the state for at least two years after serving on the
  5 10 court, except a court of appeals judge would be eligible to be
  5 11 appointed to the supreme court.
  5 12    The second amendment in the resolution eliminates the state
  5 13 judicial nominating commission and district judicial nominating
  5 14 commissions and establishes a new procedure for the appointment
  5 15 of persons to the supreme court, court of appeals, and district
  5 16 court.  The resolution requires the governor to appoint persons
  5 17 to the supreme court, court of appeals, or district court,
  5 18 subject to confirmation by a simple majority of all the members
  5 19 elected to the senate.  The resolution specifies that a vacancy
  5 20 may be filled temporarily pending confirmation.
  5 21    Under the current constitution and statutes, the state
  5 22 judicial nominating commission nominates persons for
  5 23 appointment by the governor to the supreme court and court
  5 24 of appeals and each district judicial nominating commission
  5 25 nominates persons for appointment by the governor to the
  5 26 district court bench.
  5 27    The resolution, if adopted, would be referred to the next
  5 28 general assembly (88th) for adoption a second time before the
  5 29 amendment is submitted to the electorate for ratification at
  5 30 the 2020 general election.
  5 31    The amendment, if adopted and ratified by the electorate,
  5 32 takes effect January 1, 2021.

  4  7 to the Constitution of the State of Iowa are referred to the
  4  8 general assembly to be chosen at the next general election
  4  9 for members of the general assembly, and the secretary of

  4 13                           EXPLANATION
  4 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 16    This joint resolution proposes two amendments to the
  4 17 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to the appointment
  4 18 and jurisdiction of judicial officers.
  4 19    Currently, the Iowa constitution is silent regarding the
  4 20 nomination and appointment of judges of the court of appeals.
  4 21 The first amendment in the resolution constitutionally
  4 22 establishes the minimum number of court of appeals judges at
  4 23 three judges, which is consistent with the minimum number of
  4 24 constitutionally required justices of the supreme court. The
  4 25 resolution also allows the general assembly to increase or
  4 26 decrease the number of court of appeals judges from the current
  4 27 nine judges who sit on the court of appeals.
  4 28    The resolution provides that the court of appeals shall
  4 29 have appellate jurisdiction only in cases of chancery and
  4 30 shall constitute a court for the correction of errors at law,
  4 31 under such restrictions as the general assembly may, by law,
  4 32 prescribe.  The resolution also specifies that the court of
  4 33 appeals is an inferior tribunal to the supreme court.
  4 34    The resolution provides that the judges of the court of
  4 35 appeals shall be conservators of peace throughout the state.
  5  1 The resolution establishes the term of a judge of the court
  5  2 of appeals at six years.  The term of six years is consistent
  5  3 with the existing statutory law under Code section 46.16.
  5  4    The resolution specifies that a court of appeals judge is
  5  5 eligible to receive a salary from the state which is consistent
  5  6 with other salary language applicable to a supreme court
  5  7 justice or district judge.  The resolution specifies that a
  5  8 court of appeals judge is ineligible for any other office
  5  9 of the state for at least two years after serving on the
  5 10 court, except a court of appeals judge would be eligible to be
  5 11 appointed to the supreme court.
  5 12    The second amendment in the resolution eliminates the state
  5 13 judicial nominating commission and district judicial nominating
  5 14 commissions and establishes a new procedure for the appointment
  5 15 of persons to the supreme court, court of appeals, and district
  5 16 court.  The resolution requires the governor to appoint persons
  5 17 to the supreme court, court of appeals, or district court,
  5 18 subject to confirmation by a simple majority of all the members
  5 19 elected to the senate.  The resolution specifies that a vacancy
  5 20 may be filled temporarily pending confirmation.
  5 21    Under the current constitution and statutes, the state
  5 22 judicial nominating commission nominates persons for
  5 23 appointment by the governor to the supreme court and court
  5 24 of appeals and each district judicial nominating commission
  5 25 nominates persons for appointment by the governor to the
  5 26 district court bench.
  5 27    The resolution, if adopted, would be referred to the next
  5 28 general assembly (88th) for adoption a second time before the
  5 29 amendment is submitted to the electorate for ratification at
  5 30 the 2020 general election.

  4 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 16    This joint resolution proposes two amendments to the
  4 17 Constitution of the State of Iowa relating to the appointment
  4 18 and jurisdiction of judicial officers.
  4 19    Currently, the Iowa constitution is silent regarding the
  4 20 nomination and appointment of judges of the court of appeals.
  4 21 The first amendment in the resolution constitutionally
  4 22 establishes the minimum number of court of appeals judges at
  4 23 three judges, which is consistent with the minimum number of
  4 24 constitutionally required justices of the supreme court. The
  4 25 resolution also allows the general assembly to increase or
  4 26 decrease the number of court of appeals judges from the current
  4 27 nine judges who sit on the court of appeals.
  4 28    The resolution provides that the court of appeals shall
  4 29 have appellate jurisdiction only in cases of chancery and
  4 30 shall constitute a court for the correction of errors at law,
  4 31 under such restrictions as the general assembly may, by law,
  4 32 prescribe.  The resolution also specifies that the court of
  4 33 appeals is an inferior tribunal to the supreme court.
  4 34    The resolution provides that the judges of the court of
  4 35 appeals shall be conservators of peace throughout the state.
  5  1 The resolution establishes the term of a judge of the court
  5  2 of appeals at six years.  The term of six years is consistent
  5  3 with the existing statutory law under Code section 46.16.
  5  4    The resolution specifies that a court of appeals judge is
  5  5 eligible to receive a salary from the state which is consistent
  5  6 with other salary language applicable to a supreme court
  5  7 justice or district judge.  The resolution specifies that a
  5  8 court of appeals judge is ineligible for any other office
  5  9 of the state for at least two years after serving on the
  5 10 court, except a court of appeals judge would be eligible to be
  5 11 appointed to the supreme court.
  5 12    The second amendment in the resolution eliminates the state
  5 13 judicial nominating commission and district judicial nominating
  5 14 commissions and establishes a new procedure for the appointment
  5 15 of persons to the supreme court, court of appeals, and district
  5 16 court.  The resolution requires the governor to appoint persons
  5 17 to the supreme court, court of appeals, or district court,
  5 18 subject to confirmation by a simple majority of all the members
  5 19 elected to the senate.  The resolution specifies that a vacancy
  5 20 may be filled temporarily pending confirmation.
  5 21    Under the current constitution and statutes, the state
  5 22 judicial nominating commission nominates persons for
  5 23 appointment by the governor to the supreme court and court
  5 24 of appeals and each district judicial nominating commission
  5 25 nominates persons for appointment by the governor to the
