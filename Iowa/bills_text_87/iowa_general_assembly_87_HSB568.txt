4

be
leased
or
lease-purchased
by
a
county

to
be
administered
by
the
13


county,
with
the
county’s
obligation
to
make
rent
payments

commencing
with

by
a
16


county
are

for
public
improvements
and
are
subject

a
contract
for
public
improvement
under
Code
23


section
26.2,

makes
this
type
of
contract
a

public
29

under
Code
section
