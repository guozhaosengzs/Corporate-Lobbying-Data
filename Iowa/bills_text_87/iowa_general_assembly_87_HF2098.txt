  6  2 beginning on or after January 1, 2019.

  6  4 trainees employed in Iowa on or after January 1, 2019.
  6  5                           EXPLANATION
  6  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  8    This bill creates a job training tax credit program
  6  9 (program) administered by the economic development authority
  6 10 (EDA) in consultation with the department of revenue (DOR)
  6 11 to provide tax credits to businesses that employ for pay
  6 12 qualified trainees in Iowa during the tax year.  To qualify
  6 13 as a "qualified trainee" under the program, a person must be
  6 14 an apprentice or an intern, must be employed by a business in
  6 15 Iowa, and must satisfy the relevant minimum training standard.
  6 16    "Apprentice" is defined in the bill to mean an Iowa resident
  6 17 employed in an apprenticeable occupation and registered as such
  6 18 with the U.S. office of apprenticeship.  "Intern" is defined
  6 19 in the bill to mean an Iowa college student, or a student who
  6 20 graduated from high school in Iowa but who now attends college
  6 21 outside of Iowa, who is engaged in temporary employment that
  6 22 focuses on providing the student with work experience in the
  6 23 student's field of study.
  6 24    EDA is required to establish by rule minimum training
  6 25 standards that will reflect the minimum training necessary to
  6 26 provide a meaningful work experience for an intern or to learn
  6 27 a trade or job position for an apprentice.  The bill describes
  6 28 how the minimum training standards should be quantified, as
  6 29 well as the factors EDA shall consider and the persons with
  6 30 whom EDA may consult in determining the standards.  The bill
  6 31 provides that EDA may establish more than one minimum training
  6 32 standard.
  6 33    In order to receive a tax credit, a business must apply
  6 34 to the authority in the manner and form prescribed by the
  6 35 authority, and the bill describes the required information
  7  1 that must be contained in an application.  EDA is required to
  7  2 review applications and, upon determining that the requirements
  7  3 of the program have been satisfied, issue a tax credit to the
  7  4 business.
  7  5    The tax credit equals $1,000 for each qualified trainee
  7  6 employed in Iowa by a business for the entire tax year.  If
  7  7 a qualified trainee was not employed by the business for the
  7  8 entire tax year, the amount of the credit is prorated based
  7  9 upon the number of months of employment.  The tax credit
  7 10 may be claimed against the individual and corporate income
  7 11 taxes, the franchise tax, the insurance companies tax, and the
  7 12 moneys and credits tax.  The tax credit is nonrefundable and
  7 13 nontransferable, but any excess may be carried forward for
  7 14 seven years.
  7 15    The bill requires EDA and DOR to adopt rules as necessary
  7 16 for the implementation of the bill, and requires EDA and DOR to
  7 17 publish and submit annual reports to the governor and general
  7 18 assembly containing information as described in the bill.
  7 19    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  7 20 1, 2019, and to qualified trainees employed in Iowa on or after
  7 21 that date.
