  3 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 13    This bill relates to the assessment of certain subdivided
  3 14 real property.
  3 15    Current Code section 405.1 authorizes a county board of
  3 16 supervisors to adopt an ordinance providing that property
  3 17 acquired and subdivided for development of housing shall
  3 18 continue to be assessed for taxation in the manner that it was
  3 19 prior to the acquisition for housing until the lot is sold for
  3 20 construction or occupancy of housing or five years from the
  3 21 date of subdivision, whichever is shorter. Code section 405.1
  3 22 also authorizes time extensions of certain ordinances that
  3 23 affect the assessment of property subdivided for development
  3 24 of housing and authorizes the time extensions of certain
  3 25 ordinances by counties and by cities in the portion of the
  3 26 applicable area located in the incorporated area of the city.
  3 27    The bill strikes the authorization for cities and counties
  3 28 to adopt, amend, or extend such ordinances and provides that
  3 29 property acquired and subdivided for development of housing
  3 30 shall continue to be assessed for taxation and taxed in the
  3 31 manner it was prior to its acquisition for housing until the
  3 32 lot is sold for construction or occupancy of housing. Under

  4  2 a subdivision plat was recorded is assessed for property tax
  4  3 purposes as acreage or unimproved property for five years or
  4  4 until the lot is actually improved with permanent construction,
  4  5 whichever occurs first. However, for subdivision plats
  4  6 recorded on or after January 1, 2004, but before January 1,
  4  7 2011, the time limit is eight years.
  4  8    The bill strikes the portions of Code section 441.72
  4  9 relating to the five=year limitation and the eight=year
  4 10 limitation and provides that when a subdivision plat is
  4 11 recorded, the individual lots within the subdivision plat shall
  4 12 not be assessed in excess of the total assessment of the land
  4 13 as acreage or unimproved property until the lot is actually
  4 14 improved with permanent construction.
  4 15    The bill shall not be construed to require the refund
  4 16 or modification of property taxes that are attributable to
  4 17 assessment years beginning before January 1, 2018, or the
  4 18 adjustment of property assessments for assessment years
  4 19 beginning before January 1, 2018.  The bill also provides that
  4 20 local ordinances adopted under existing Code section 405.1
  4 21 in effect on the effective date of the bill are invalid for
  4 22 purposes of assessment years beginning on or after January 1,
  4 23 2018.
  4 24    The bill applies to assessment years beginning on or after
  4 25 January 1, 2018.

  3 27    The bill strikes the authorization for cities and counties
