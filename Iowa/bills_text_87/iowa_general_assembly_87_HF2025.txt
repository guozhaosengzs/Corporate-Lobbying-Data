  6  7                           EXPLANATION
  6  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 10    Article II, section 5, of the Constitution of the State of
  6 11 Iowa denies the privilege of an elector to any person convicted
  6 12 of an infamous crime.  State statute defines infamous crime as
  6 13 a felony conviction under state or federal law.  State law also
  6 14 allows a person who has been discharged from parole, probation,
  6 15 or work release, or who has been released from incarceration
  6 16 upon completion of sentence, to apply to the governor for
  6 17 restoration of the rights of citizenship, which include the
  6 18 rights to register to vote and to vote.  State statute also
  6 19 requires that a candidate for elective office under the laws of
  6 20 the state must be an eligible elector at the time of election.
  6 21 By operation of law, this excludes persons who have been
  6 22 convicted of a state or federal felony and not had their rights
  6 23 of citizenship restored by the governor or the president of the
  6 24 United States.

  6  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 10    Article II, section 5, of the Constitution of the State of
  6 11 Iowa denies the privilege of an elector to any person convicted
  6 12 of an infamous crime.  State statute defines infamous crime as
  6 13 a felony conviction under state or federal law.  State law also
  6 14 allows a person who has been discharged from parole, probation,
  6 15 or work release, or who has been released from incarceration
  6 16 upon completion of sentence, to apply to the governor for
  6 17 restoration of the rights of citizenship, which include the
  6 18 rights to register to vote and to vote.  State statute also
  6 19 requires that a candidate for elective office under the laws of
  6 20 the state must be an eligible elector at the time of election.
  6 21 By operation of law, this excludes persons who have been
  6 22 convicted of a state or federal felony and not had their rights

  6 25    This bill alters the definition of "infamous crime" to
  6 26 include only vote fraud that is election misconduct in the
  6 27 first degree under Code section 39A.2. The bill also limits
  6 28 the disqualification from holding the privilege of an elector
  6 29 due to conviction of an infamous crime to the period of the

  6 31 to vote and hold office is restored automatically upon the
  6 32 discharge of that person's sentence, including any period of
  6 33 probation or parole, but not including the payment of fines,
  6 34 fees, or restitution.

  7  1 federal law.
