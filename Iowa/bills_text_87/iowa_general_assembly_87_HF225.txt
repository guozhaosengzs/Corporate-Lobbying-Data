  6 23                           EXPLANATION
  6 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 26    This bill eliminates a deferred sentence as a criminal
  6 27 sentencing option as of July 1, 2017.
  6 28     Current law defines a deferred sentencing option to mean
  6 29 when a court enters an adjudication (conviction) of guilt but
  6 30 does not impose a sentence. Furthermore, under a deferred
  6 31 sentencing option the court retains the power to sentence the
  6 32 defendant to any sentence it originally could have imposed
  6 33 subject to the defendant's compliance with conditions set by
  6 34 the court as a requirement of the deferred sentence.
  6 35    The bill does not strike every instance of the word "deferred
  7  1 sentence" from the Code due to the use of a defendant's
  7  2 previous "deferred sentence" to enhance possible future
  7  3 criminal penalties.
  7  4    The bill does permit a youthful offender to receive a
  7  5 deferred sentence under Code section 907.3A.
