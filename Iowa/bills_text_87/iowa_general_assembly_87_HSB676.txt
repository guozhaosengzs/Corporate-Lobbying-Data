if
the
direct

7


more
economical
than
purchasing
through
the

if
8


the

or
if

Division

of
this

concerns

the

Current
law
permits
31


a
state
agency,
upon
request
and
approval
by
the
department
32


of
administrative
services,
to
make
a
purchase
of
goods
or
33


services
directly
from
a
vendor,
rather
than
purchasing
through
34


the
department,
if
one
of
certain
conditions
is
met.

H.F.
_____


the
conditions
is
if
the
purchase
will
not
exceed
$10,000
and
1


the
purchase
would
contribute
to
the
agency
complying
with
2


targeted
small
business
procurement
goals.
3


The
bill
modifies
that
condition
to
permit
a
state
agency
4


to
engage
in
direct
purchasing
for
any
purchase
that
will
not
5


exceed
$25,000.
The
bill
also
strikes
the
requirement
for
6


a
prior
request
and
approval
by
the
department
for
direct
7


purchasing.
The
bill
requires
a
state
agency
that
makes
such
8


a
purchase
to
promptly
notify
the
department
that
it
has
done
9


so.
The
bill
provides
that
the
notification
must
include
10


documentation
demonstrating
that
the
purchase
met
the
criteria
11


for
a
direct
purchase
provided
in
the
bill.
The
bill
provides
12


that
prior
notification
of
or
approval
by
the
department
for
13


such
purchases
shall
not
be
required.
The
bill
provides
that
14


competitive
bidding
shall
not
be
required
for
such
purchases.
15


In
addition,
for
a
direct
purchase
of
$25,000
or
less
that
is
16


not
due
to
an
immediate
or
emergency
need,
the
state
agency
17


shall,
if
multiple
bidders
are
practicable,
solicit
bids
from
18


at
least
three
Iowa-based
businesses
and
select
the
bid
that
19


best
meets
the
needs
of
the
state
agency.
20


The
bill
also
provides
that
a
state
agency
that
meets
the
21


requirements
for
direct
purchasing
provided
in
the
bill
may
22


engage
in
direct
purchasing
instead
of
purchasing
pursuant
to
a
23


master
contract
established
by
the
department.
24


Division
II
of
the
bill
concerns
claims
for
reimbursement
of
25


out-of-state
travel
by
executive
branch
employees.
Current
law
26


requires
the
department
of
administrative
services
to
develop
27


and
implement
an
electronic
travel
authorization
form
which
28


shall
be
used
by
an
executive
branch
employee
when
requesting
29


reimbursement
for
out-of-state
travel.
The
bill
strikes
the


30


requirement
for
development
and
use
of
the
electronic
travel
31


form
and
instead
provides
that
a
claim
for
reimbursement
shall
32


be
allowed
upon
the
approval
of
the
claim
by
the
head
of
the
33


employee’s
state
agency.
The
bill
requires
each
state
agency
34


with
authority
to
approve
claims
to
establish
a
process
