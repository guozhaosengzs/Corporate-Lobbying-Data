  4  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  4    This bill amends Code section 321.299 to require the driver
  4  5 of a vehicle overtaking a person riding a bicycle proceeding
  4  6 in the same direction on a roadway to pass to the left of the
  4  7 bicycle in an adjacent travel lane or on the opposite side of
  4  8 the roadway, and prohibits the driver from returning to the
  4  9 right side of the roadway until safely clear of the overtaken
  4 10 bicycle in accordance with Code section 321.281. Code section
  4 11 321.281 prohibits a person operating a vehicle from steering
  4 12 the vehicle unreasonably close to or toward a person riding
  4 13 a bicycle on a highway. This provision of the bill does not
  4 14 apply if the bicycle is traveling on a paved shoulder or in a
  4 15 lane designated for the travel of bicycles.
  4 16    A violation of Code section 321.281 is punishable by a
  4 17 scheduled fine of $250 and a violation of Code section 321.299
  4 18 is punishable by a scheduled fine of $100. However, if a
  4 19 violation of Code section 321.299 causes a serious injury,
  4 20 a court could impose an additional fine of $500 or suspend
  4 21 the person's driver's license for not more than 90 days, or
  4 22 both. If the violation causes a death, a court could impose
  4 23 an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's driver's
  4 24 license for not more than 180 days, or both.
  4 25    Under Code section 321.234, a person riding a bicycle on the
  4 26 highway is subject to the provisions of Code chapter 321 (motor
  4 27 vehicles and law of the road) and has all the rights and duties
  4 28 applicable to the driver of a vehicle. Under Code section
  4 29 321.304, the bill specifies that a vehicle is prohibited from
  4 30 overtaking and passing a bicycle when approaching the crest of
  4 31 a grade or upon a curve in the highway where the driver's view
  4 32 along the highway is obstructed for a distance of approximately
  4 33 700 feet; when approaching within 100 feet of any narrow
  4 34 bridge, viaduct, or tunnel; or when approaching within 100 feet
  4 35 of or traversing any intersection or railroad grade crossing.
  5  1 However, the bill provides that a vehicle may pass a bicycle
  5  2 where official signs are in place directing that traffic keep
  5  3 to the right or a distinctive center line or off=center line is
  5  4 marked, provided the vehicle complies with current requirements
  5  5 for overtaking on the left.
  5  6    A violation of Code section 321.304 is punishable by a
  5  7 scheduled fine of $100. However, if the violation causes a
  5  8 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  5  9 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  5 10 days, or both. If the violation causes a death, a court could
  5 11 impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's
  5 12 driver's license for not more than 180 days, or both.
  5 13    Current law requires a bicycle to have a front lighted lamp
  5 14 and either a rear lighted lamp or a rear reflector at any time
  5 15 from sunset to sunrise, and at such other times when conditions
  5 16 such as fog, snow, sleet, or rain provide insufficient lighting
  5 17 to render clearly discernible persons and vehicles on the
  5 18 highway at a distance of 500 feet ahead.
  5 19    During the periods of time stated above, the bill instead
  5 20 requires a bicycle to be equipped with a lamp on the front
  5 21 exhibiting a steady or flashing white light visible from a
  5 22 distance of at least 300 feet to the front, and every bicycle
  5 23 or bicycle rider to be equipped with a lamp exhibiting a steady
  5 24 or flashing red light visible from a distance of 300 feet to
  5 25 the rear. However, the bill provides that a local authority
  5 26 may authorize a red reflector to be used in lieu of a rear
  5 27 light.
  5 28    The scheduled fine for a violation of this provision is
  5 29 $25. However, the bill provides that a citation issued for
  5 30 failure to have a front lamp, rear lamp, or rear reflector on a
  5 31 bicycle or on a bicycle rider must first provide for a 72=hour
  5 32 period within which the person charged with the violation
  5 33 shall replace or repair the lamp or reflector. If the person
  5 34 complies with the directive to replace or repair the bicycle
  5 35 lamp or reflector, the citation must be expunged.
