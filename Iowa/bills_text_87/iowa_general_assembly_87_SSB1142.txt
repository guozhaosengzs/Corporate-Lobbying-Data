generally
includes
postsecondary
education
student
loans
made
1


by
the
United
States
or
a
federal
agency
or
instrumentality,
a
2


state
or
political
subdivision
of
a
state,
a
tax-exempt
public
3


benefit
corporation
controlling
a
hospital,
certain
educational
4


organizations,
or
private
educational
lenders.
5


The
exemption
applies
to
qualified
student
loans
discharged
6


on
account
of
the
death
or
total
and
permanent
disability
of
7


the
student
or
borrower
pursuant
to
provisions
of
title
IV
8


of
the
federal
Higher
Education
Act
of
1965
(federal
student
9


financial
aid
programs).
10


Alternatively,
the
exemption
applies
to
qualified
student
11


loans
otherwise
discharged
on
account
of
the
death
or
total
and
12


permanent
disability
of
the
student
or
borrower.
For
purposes
13


of
the
bill,
“total
and
permanent
disability”
is
defined
to
14


mean
the
same
as
it
does
for
purposes
of
the
federal
student
15


financial
aid
programs,
which
generally
include
individuals
who
16


are
unable
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity
by
reason
17


of
a
physical
or
mental
impairment
that
can
be
expected
to
18


result
in
death
and
that
has
lasted
or
will
last
for
at
least
60
19


months,
or
individuals
who
are
determined
by
the
secretary
of
20


veterans
affairs
to
be
unemployable
due
to
a
service-connected
21


disability.
For
this
alternative,
the
bill
requires
total
and
22


permanent
disability
to
be
proven
using
the
same
documentation
23


required
for
purposes
of
the
federal
student
financial
24


aid
programs,
which
require
a
physician
certification,
a
25


social
security
administration
disability
determination,
or
26


documentation
from
the
department
of
veterans
affairs.
27


The
bill
applies
retroactively
to
January
1,
2017,
for
tax
28


years
beginning
on
