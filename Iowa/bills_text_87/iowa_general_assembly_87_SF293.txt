  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives

  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory

  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory

  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section

  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and

  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure

  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  3 10 to which the process of approving applications for the
  3 11 construction of confinement feeding operation structures,
  3 12 including the siting of such structures and the use of manure
  3 13 management practices, may be improved.  The advisory committee
  3 14 shall consider the functions of cities and counties in this
  3 15 process and the limitations imposed on county boards of
  3 16 supervisors to make decisions regulating the construction and
  3 17 management of confinement feeding operations under section

  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct

  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  3 10 to which the process of approving applications for the
  3 11 construction of confinement feeding operation structures,
  3 12 including the siting of such structures and the use of manure
  3 13 management practices, may be improved.  The advisory committee
  3 14 shall consider the functions of cities and counties in this
  3 15 process and the limitations imposed on county boards of
  3 16 supervisors to make decisions regulating the construction and
  3 17 management of confinement feeding operations under section

  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  2 35 in the master matrix used to score an application, including
  3  1 the impact of a proposed construction on water quality, air
  3  2 quality, and  community, as well as public health, secondary
  3  3 road systems, and public utilities. The advisory committee
  3  4 shall evaluate the necessity of retaining existing criteria or
  3  5 adding new criteria.
  3  6    c.  The manner in which criteria is scored, including the use
  3  7 of a positive and negative point system, and the calculation of
  3  8 a minimum threshold score to receive a satisfactory rating.

  3 10 to which the process of approving applications for the
  3 11 construction of confinement feeding operation structures,
  3 12 including the siting of such structures and the use of manure
  3 13 management practices, may be improved.  The advisory committee
  3 14 shall consider the functions of cities and counties in this
  3 15 process and the limitations imposed on county boards of
  3 16 supervisors to make decisions regulating the construction and
  3 17 management of confinement feeding operations under section
  3 18 331.304A.
  3 19    9.  The advisory committee may conduct hearings throughout
  3 20 the state to receive public comments.  The committee shall
  3 21 conduct surveys of county boards of supervisors throughout the
  3 22 state.  All hearings and meetings of the advisory committee
  3 23 shall be open to the public.
  3 24    10.  The advisory committee shall prepare and submit a
  3 25 report to the governor and general assembly not later than
  3 26 December 15, 2017.  The report shall include the findings
  3 27 and recommendations of the advisory committee, including
  3 28 proposed legislation for consideration by the eighty=seventh
  3 29 general assembly and a proposed notice of intended action for
  3 30 the adoption of rules for consideration by the environmental
  3 31 protection commission.  The committee shall discontinue its

  4  4    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ESTABLISHMENT OF A MASTER MATRIX
  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  3 10 to which the process of approving applications for the
  3 11 construction of confinement feeding operation structures,
  3 12 including the siting of such structures and the use of manure
  3 13 management practices, may be improved.  The advisory committee
  3 14 shall consider the functions of cities and counties in this
  3 15 process and the limitations imposed on county boards of
  3 16 supervisors to make decisions regulating the construction and
  3 17 management of confinement feeding operations under section
  3 18 331.304A.

  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory

  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure

  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement

  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory

  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  4  5 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.  This bill establishes a master matrix
  4  6 advisory committee to evaluate the use and value of the
  4  7 department of natural resource's master matrix and the process
  4  8 of evaluating and approving or disapproving applications to
  4  9 establish or expand confinement feeding operations.
  4 10    BILL'S PROVISIONS == COMPOSITION OF COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP
  4 11 AND PROCEDURES.  The advisory committee is to be composed
  4 12 of (1) members of state agencies regulating environmental
  4 13 protection, agriculture, and public health; (2) representatives
  4 14 of private organizations interested in the environment and
  4 15 natural resources, the interests of counties and cities, public
  4 16 health, and utilities; and (3) representatives of private
  4 17 organizations associated with agricultural production which
  4 18 includes both crop production (corn and soybeans) and animal
  4 19 agricultural production (swine, cattle, and poultry).  The bill
  4 20 includes four members of the general assembly.  The advisory
  4 21 committee is to be staffed by departmental employees, an
  4 22 assistant attorney general, and a person appointed by Iowa
  4 23 state university of science and technology.  The bill provides
  4 24 procedures for the operation of the advisory committee,
  4 25 including the designation of a chairperson, quorum and voting
  4 26 requirements, and compensation.
  4 27    BILL'S PROVISIONS == DUTIES.  The advisory committee
  4 28 is required to consider the use and value of different
  4 29 subcategories of criteria in the master matrix used to score an
  4 30 application, and the manner in which criteria is scored.  The
  4 31 advisory committee is also required to determine the extent to
  4 32 which the process of approving the construction of confinement
  4 33 feeding operation structures may be improved and statutory
  4 34 limitations imposed upon counties to regulate confinement
  4 35 feeding operations.  The advisory committee may conduct
  5  1 hearings throughout the state and conduct surveys of county
  5  2 boards of supervisors.  The advisory committee must prepare and
  5  3 submit a report to the governor and general assembly not later
  5  4 than December 15, 2017.  The report must include the advisory
  5  5 committee's findings and recommendations, including proposed
  5  6 legislation and rulemaking documents.  The bill takes effect
  5  7 upon enactment and is repealed on July 1, 2018.
  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5  8    BACKGROUND == TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5  9 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 10 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 11 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 12 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or
  5 21 would use an unformed manure storage structure (Code section
  5 22 459.304).
  5 23    BACKGROUND == MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 24 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  6  4 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  6  5 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  6  6 the department (Code section 459.304), which decides whether to
  6  7 approve or disapprove the application (Code section 459.303).
  6  8 A county is statutorily preempted from approving, denying, or
  6  9 imposing conditions upon the construction of a confinement
  6 10 feeding operation structure or the management of manure
  6 11 originating from the operation (Code section 331.304A).

  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
  5 33 applicant if the separation distance is increased by 250
  5 34 feet (567 IAC ch. 65 Appendix B).  The master matrix includes
  5 35 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  6  1 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  6  2 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  6  3 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of

  5 13 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 14 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 15 12=month period.
  5 16    BACKGROUND == PERMIT REQUIREMENTS.  A person must obtain a
  5 17 permit from the department before constructing a confinement
  5 18 feeding operation structure (Code section 459.303), if the
  5 19 confinement feeding operation meets a minimum threshold
  5 20 capacity of 1,000 animal units (2,500 swine over 55 pounds) or

  5 25 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 26 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or use
  5 27 manure management practices in a manner that exceeds specific
  5 28 state law requirements.  For example, Code section 459.202
  5 29 requires a confinement feeding operation with an animal unit
  5 30 capacity of less than 1,000 animal units to be located at a
  5 31 minimum separation distance of 1,250 feet from an educational
  5 32 institution.  The master matrix awards five points to the
