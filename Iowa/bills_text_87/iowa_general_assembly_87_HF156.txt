  5  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 10    This bill, titled the "Right to Try Act", permits
  5 11 manufacturers of investigational drugs, biological products, or
  5 12 devices to make available, and eligible patients with terminal
  5 13 illnesses to attempt treatment with, an investigational
  5 14 drug, biological product, or device as long as they provided
  5 15 written informed consent. The bill defines the terms "eligible
  5 16 patient", "terminal illness", "investigational drug, biological
  5 17 product, or device", and "written informed consent".
  5 18    Under the bill, an eligible patient's physician must
  5 19 acknowledge that the patient's illness is terminal and
  5 20 recommend the patient try an investigational drug, biological
  5 21 product, or device. The patient's written informed consent
  5 22 must acknowledge that treatments currently approved by the
  5 23 United Stated food and drug administration are unlikely to
  5 24 prolong the patient's life. It must identify the specific
  5 25 treatment sought and the potential best, worst, and expected
  5 26 results from the treatment. It must acknowledge that the
  5 27 patient's insurance is not required to pay for the treatment
  5 28 and that any hospice service may refuse to accept the patient
  5 29 after receiving the treatment. It must also acknowledge
  5 30 that expenses will be credited to the patient, including the
  5 31 patient's estate, unless an agreement with the manufacturer of
  5 32 an investigational drug, biological product, or device states
  5 33 otherwise. If the patient dies during treatment, the patient's
  5 34 heirs are not liable for any remaining debts unless otherwise
  5 35 required by law.
  6  1 The manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological
  6  2 product, or device may charge an eligible patient or provide
  6  3 the treatment free of charge. Governmental entities are
  6  4 not required to pay costs associated with the use, care, or
  6  5 treatment of a patient with an investigational drug, biological
  6  6 product, or device. The bill does not require hospitals
  6  7 licensed under chapter 135B or other health care facilities to
  6  8 provide new or additional services.
  6  9    Consistent with existing law, the board of medicine shall
  6 10 not take an adverse action against a physician's license solely

  6 15 investigational drug, biological product, or device for any
  6 16 harm done to the patient resulting from the treatment if the

  5 10    This bill, titled the "Right to Try Act", permits
  5 11 manufacturers of investigational drugs, biological products, or
  5 12 devices to make available, and eligible patients with terminal
  5 13 illnesses to attempt treatment with, an investigational
  5 14 drug, biological product, or device as long as they provided
  5 15 written informed consent. The bill defines the terms "eligible
  5 16 patient", "terminal illness", "investigational drug, biological
  5 17 product, or device", and "written informed consent".
  5 18    Under the bill, an eligible patient's physician must
  5 19 acknowledge that the patient's illness is terminal and
  5 20 recommend the patient try an investigational drug, biological
  5 21 product, or device. The patient's written informed consent
  5 22 must acknowledge that treatments currently approved by the
  5 23 United Stated food and drug administration are unlikely to
  5 24 prolong the patient's life. It must identify the specific
  5 25 treatment sought and the potential best, worst, and expected
  5 26 results from the treatment. It must acknowledge that the
  5 27 patient's insurance is not required to pay for the treatment
  5 28 and that any hospice service may refuse to accept the patient
  5 29 after receiving the treatment. It must also acknowledge
  5 30 that expenses will be credited to the patient, including the
  5 31 patient's estate, unless an agreement with the manufacturer of
  5 32 an investigational drug, biological product, or device states
  5 33 otherwise. If the patient dies during treatment, the patient's
  5 34 heirs are not liable for any remaining debts unless otherwise
  5 35 required by law.
  6  1 The manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological
  6  2 product, or device may charge an eligible patient or provide
  6  3 the treatment free of charge. Governmental entities are
  6  4 not required to pay costs associated with the use, care, or
  6  5 treatment of a patient with an investigational drug, biological
  6  6 product, or device. The bill does not require hospitals
  6  7 licensed under chapter 135B or other health care facilities to
  6  8 provide new or additional services.
  6  9    Consistent with existing law, the board of medicine shall
  6 10 not take an adverse action against a physician's license solely
  6 11 for recommending an investigational drug, biological product,
  6 12 or device for the physician's eligible patient. The bill does
  6 13 not create a new private cause of action against any person or

  6 15 investigational drug, biological product, or device for any
  6 16 harm done to the patient resulting from the treatment if the
