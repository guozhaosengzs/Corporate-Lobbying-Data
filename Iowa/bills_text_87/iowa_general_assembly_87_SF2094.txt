  1 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 12    Under current law, a child under six years of age who is
  1 13 being transported in a motor vehicle, except a school bus or
  1 14 motorcycle, must be secured during transit by a child restraint
  1 15 system that is used in accordance with the manufacturer's
  1 16 instructions. If the child is under one year of age and
  1 17 weighs less than 20 pounds, the child restraint system must be
  1 18 rear=facing. A child restraint system is a specially designed
  1 19 seating system, including a belt=positioning seat or a booster
  1 20 seat, that meets federal motor vehicle safety standards set
  1 21 forth in 49 C.F.R. {571.213.
  1 22    This bill amends current law to require that if the child
  1 23 is under two years of age, the child restraint system must be
  1 24 rear=facing regardless of the child's weight.
  1 25    Under current law, a violation of the provision is a simple
  1 26 misdemeanor punishable by a scheduled fine of $100. A court
  1 27 is prohibited from convicting a person who is charged with a
  1 28 first violation of the provision if the person produces in
  1 29 court, within a reasonable time, proof that the person has
  1 30 purchased or otherwise acquired a child restraint system which
  1 31 meets federal motor vehicle safety standards. Failure to use a
  1 32 child restraint system does not constitute negligence nor is
  1 33 the failure admissible as evidence in a civil action. Failure
  1 34 to use a child restraint system is prohibited from being
  1 35 considered by the department of transportation in determining
  2  1 whether to suspend a person's driver's license (Code section
  2  2 321.210), but the violation is considered in determining
  2  3 habitual offender status (Code section 321.555).
