127 34    Sec. 129.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of
131  7 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  8 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
131  9 supervision of the commission.

130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust

130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the

127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three

128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all

128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if

127 34    Sec. 129.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of
131  7 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  8 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
131  9 supervision of the commission.

127 34    Sec. 129.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of

127 34    Sec. 129.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three

130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of

130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a

127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all

130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.

127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three

130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20

130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in

130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of

127 34    Sec. 129.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was

130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,

127 34    Sec. 129.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of

127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of
131  7 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  8 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
131  9 supervision of the commission.

128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of
131  7 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  8 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
131  9 supervision of the commission.

127 34    Sec. 129.  NAME CHANGE TO REFERENDUM FOR DIRECT USE.  Nothing
127 35 in this Act requires the department of agriculture and land
128  1 stewardship or a commodity organization described in section
128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum
128  3 because of this Act's reference to a referendum as a referendum
128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of
131  7 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  8 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
131  9 supervision of the commission.

128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,

129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three

130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a

128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of
131  7 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural

128  2 466B.51, as enacted in this Act, to conduct a referendum

128  4 for direct use.
128  5                           EXPLANATION
128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of
131  7 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  8 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall

128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water

128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs
131  6 and associated projects administered by the department of
131  7 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  8 resources, and the Iowa finance authority under the overall
131  9 supervision of the commission.

128  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
128  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve

129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all
131  5 water quality and soil conservation initiatives and programs

128  8    This bill relates to agricultural commodity organizations
128  9 representing producers of that commodity that are authorized
128 10 to impose an excise tax or "assessment" (and commonly
128 11 referred to as a "checkoff") on the commodity when first
128 12 sold by the producer to a first purchaser.  The goal of the
128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers
128 19 council or Iowa pork producers association (Code chapter 183A),
128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
131  3 2019, which includes a description of current clean water
131  4 programs and projects and a detailed plan for consolidating all

128 13 assessment is to fund promotional activities which involve
128 14 market development, research, and education.  The commodity
128 15 organizations include the Iowa dairy industry commission or
128 16 Iowa state dairy association (Code chapter 179), Iowa beef
128 17 cattle producers association (Code chapter 181), Iowa sheep and
128 18 wool promotion board (Code chapter 182), Iowa pork producers

128 20 Iowa egg council (Code chapter 184), the Iowa turkey marketing
128 21 council (Code chapter 184A), the Iowa soybean association
128 22 (Code chapter 185), and the Iowa corn promotion board (Code
128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited

129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.

128 23 chapter 185C).  The bill requires a commodity organization
128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax

128 24 to establish a separate state assessment for clean water, if
128 25 approved by a majority of its members at a referendum.  The
128 26 bill also requires commodity organizations to conduct a special
128 27 referendum to increase the rate of the assessment for clean
128 28 water. The rate of the state assessment is established by the
128 29 governing body of the commodity organization not to exceed the
128 30 assessment for direct use or national assessment or both. The
128 31 referendum would be conducted in the same manner as an initial
128 32 or special referendum conducted by the commodity organization
128 33 under its specific Code chapter.  The special assessment could
128 34 be continued or terminated in the same manner as the commodity
128 35 organization's assessment for promotional activities.  Moneys
129  1 from the state assessment would be collected by the commodity
129  2 organization and transferred to a newly created clean water
129  3 fund.
129  4    The bill establishes a clean water commission housed in
129  5 the division of soil conservation and water quality of the
129  6 department of agriculture and land stewardship.  The commission
129  7 is composed of nine voting members appointed by the governor,
129  8 four legislative members who serve in a nonvoting, ex officio
129  9 capacity, and persons appointed by the commodity organizations,
129 10 who also serve in a nonvoting, ex officio capacity.
129 11 Appointments are contingent on the commodity organization
129 12 having approved the establishment of a state assessment for
129 13 clean water to be transferred to the clean water fund. The
129 14 purpose of the commission is to finance methods to improve
129 15 surface water quality, including by reducing contributing
129 16 contaminant loads to receiving surface waters and reducing soil
129 17 erosion and sediment loss. The commission is responsible for
129 18 overseeing the water quality initiative as administered by the
129 19 division of soil conservation and water quality.
129 20    Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be
129 21 credited to the clean water fund which is under the supervision
129 22 of the commission.  The fund is composed of a general
129 23 account, an assessment account, and an expenditures account.
129 24 The fund's general account includes moneys transferred
129 25 from the constitutionally protected natural resources and
129 26 outdoor recreation trust fund (Code section 461.31), moneys
129 27 appropriated by the general assembly, and other moneys
129 28 available to and obtained or accepted by the commission.
129 29 Moneys collected from the state assessment are to be credited
129 30 to the assessment account.  The bill also includes an
129 31 expenditures account which only includes moneys transferred
129 32 from the general account and the assessment account for
129 33 purposes of financing methods to improve surface water quality.
129 34 Moneys transferred from the assessment account are to be used
129 35 to reimburse the department of agriculture and land stewardship
130  1 or a commodity organization for reasonable costs of conducting
130  2 a referendum to determine if a state assessment for clean water
130  3 is to be established, continued, or terminated.  The commission
130  4 can also apply to the executive council for moneys required to
130  5 pay for reasonable costs of conducting a referendum.  Moneys
130  6 deposited into the expenditures account may also be used to
130  7 pay refunds to producers who have paid the state assessment
130  8 if the refund application has been approved by the commodity
130  9 organization.
130 10    The bill provides for possible progressive increases
130 11 in state sales and use taxes.  An increased amount must be
130 12 credited to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
130 13 fund according to a constitutional amendment (Article VII,
130 14 section 10).  The amount credited to the fund must be equal
130 15 to the amount generated by an increase in the state sales tax
130 16 rate occurring after the effective date of the constitutional
130 17 amendment, not to exceed a rate of three=eighths of one percent
130 18 (0.375).  The state sales tax rate has not been increased since
130 19 November 2, 2010, the date when the constitutional amendment
130 20 was ratified.  The bill provides that an increase of one=eighth
130 21 of one percent in the sales tax is triggered each of three
130 22 fiscal years when the secretary of agriculture, the treasurer
130 23 of state, and the auditor of state certify that a total of $20
130 24 million in clean water assessments for that preceding year was
130 25 collected by participating commodity organizations.  The bill
130 26 revises the allocations from the natural resources and outdoor
130 27 recreation trust fund as set forth in statute (Code chapter
130 28 461).  On July 1 of each fiscal year, an amount of moneys in
130 29 the Code chapter 461 trust fund equal to the amount in the
130 30 clean water fund's assessment account is to be transferred to
130 31 the clean water fund's general account.  The moneys remaining
130 32 in the Code chapter 461 trust fund are to be allocated on a
130 33 percentage basis as set forth in statute.
130 34    The commission, in cooperation with the department of
130 35 agriculture and land stewardship, the department of natural
131  1 resources, and the Iowa finance authority, must submit a
131  2 report to the governor and general assembly by January 15,
