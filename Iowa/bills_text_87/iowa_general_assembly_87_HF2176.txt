  2 28 school district's comprehensive school improvement plan by
  2 29 July 1, 2019. The content of the training shall be based on
  2 30 nationally recognized best practices.  The bill provides a
  2 31 similar requirement for training on trauma=informed care for
  2 32 school personnel who have regular contact with students in
  2 33 kindergarten through grade 12.
  2 34    The bill requires the department of education to adopt rules

  3  1 prevention and postvention and trauma=informed care based on
  3  2 nationally recognized best practices. The bill requires the

  3  6    The bill defines "trauma=informed care" as services that are

  3  8 of individuals who have experienced trauma, recognize the role
  3  9 trauma has played in the lives of those individuals, recognize
  3 10 the presence and onset of trauma symptoms, are supportive of
  3 11 trauma recovery, and avoid further traumatization. The bill
  3 12 defines "postvention" as the provision of crisis intervention,
  3 13 support, and assistance for those affected by a suicide or
  3 14 suicide attempt to prevent further risk of suicide.
  3 15    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  3 16 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  3 17 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  3 18 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  3 19 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  3 20 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
