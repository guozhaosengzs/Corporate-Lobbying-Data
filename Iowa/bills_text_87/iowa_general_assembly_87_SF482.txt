 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 17 32    2.  The purpose of the program is to support watershed
 17 33 projects and advance implementation of the latest version of
 17 34 the "Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy" initially presented
 17 35 in November 2012 by the department of agriculture and land
 18  1 stewardship, the department of natural resources, and Iowa
 18  2 state university of science and technology, which program
 18  3 support may include demonstration projects that decrease
 18  4 erosion, precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm
 18  5 water discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 18  6 The program's projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water
 18  7 management manual published by the department of natural
 18  8 resources.
 18  9    3.  The program shall be financed on a cost=share basis or
 18 10 through cooperative agreements with watershed projects funded
 18 11 through section 455B.199 whose project activities fall outside
 18 12 the territorial boundaries of a city.
 18 13    4.  Any state moneys used to finance a project under a water
 18 14 quality urban infrastructure program shall be administered
 18 15 according to an agreement entered into by the division and the
 18 16 owner of the land where the infrastructure is to be installed.
 18 17 The agreement shall include standard terms and conditions
 18 18 for the receipt of program moneys and any other terms and
 18 19 conditions the division deems necessary or convenient for
 18 20 the efficient administration of the project or program.  The
 18 21 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure

 18 28 infrastructure program to instead support the three=year data
 18 29 collection of in=field agricultural practices project as
 18 30 enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 18 31    6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section
 18 32 to the contrary, the division may use any amount available
 18 33 to support the water quality urban infrastructure program to
 18 34 develop and maintain an online resource displaying measurable
 18 35 indicators of desirable change in water quality within the
 19  1 state's watersheds.  These measurable indicators may include
 19  2 but are not limited to public and private funding inputs,
 19  3 involvement in water quality projects, and improvements, land
 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor
 19  8 and the general assembly itemizing expenditures under the
 19  9 program during the previous fiscal year.
 19 10    8.  Any information obtained by the division identifying a
 19 11 person holding a legal interest in land or specific land shall
 19 12 be a confidential record under section 22.7.
 19 13    Sec. 24.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the intent of the
 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under

 19 12 be a confidential record under section 22.7.
 19 13    Sec. 24.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the intent of the
 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the

 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide

 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under

 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to

 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by

 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 18 22 on a single parcel of land.  The division may annually use an
 18 23 amount of not more than four percent of the moneys used to
 18 24 support the program for administrative purposes.
 18 25    5.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section
 18 26 to the contrary, beginning on July 1, 2019, the division may
 18 27 use any amount available to support the water quality urban
 18 28 infrastructure program to instead support the three=year data
 18 29 collection of in=field agricultural practices project as
 18 30 enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 18 31    6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section
 18 32 to the contrary, the division may use any amount available
 18 33 to support the water quality urban infrastructure program to
 18 34 develop and maintain an online resource displaying measurable
 18 35 indicators of desirable change in water quality within the
 19  1 state's watersheds.  These measurable indicators may include
 19  2 but are not limited to public and private funding inputs,
 19  3 involvement in water quality projects, and improvements, land
 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor
 19  8 and the general assembly itemizing expenditures under the

 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the

 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3

 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure

 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.
       LSB 1844SV (3) 87
       mm/sc

 18 15 according to an agreement entered into by the division and the
 18 16 owner of the land where the infrastructure is to be installed.
 18 17 The agreement shall include standard terms and conditions
 18 18 for the receipt of program moneys and any other terms and
 18 19 conditions the division deems necessary or convenient for
 18 20 the efficient administration of the project or program.  The
 18 21 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 18 22 on a single parcel of land.  The division may annually use an
 18 23 amount of not more than four percent of the moneys used to
 18 24 support the program for administrative purposes.
 18 25    5.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section
 18 26 to the contrary, beginning on July 1, 2019, the division may
 18 27 use any amount available to support the water quality urban
 18 28 infrastructure program to instead support the three=year data
 18 29 collection of in=field agricultural practices project as
 18 30 enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 18 31    6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section
 18 32 to the contrary, the division may use any amount available
 18 33 to support the water quality urban infrastructure program to
 18 34 develop and maintain an online resource displaying measurable

 19  1 state's watersheds.  These measurable indicators may include
 19  2 but are not limited to public and private funding inputs,
 19  3 involvement in water quality projects, and improvements, land
 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor
 19  8 and the general assembly itemizing expenditures under the
 19  9 program during the previous fiscal year.
 19 10    8.  Any information obtained by the division identifying a

 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department

 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering

 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19  1 state's watersheds.  These measurable indicators may include
 19  2 but are not limited to public and private funding inputs,
 19  3 involvement in water quality projects, and improvements, land
 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.

 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 18 25    5.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this section
 18 26 to the contrary, beginning on July 1, 2019, the division may
 18 27 use any amount available to support the water quality urban
 18 28 infrastructure program to instead support the three=year data
 18 29 collection of in=field agricultural practices project as
 18 30 enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 18 31    6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section
 18 32 to the contrary, the division may use any amount available
 18 33 to support the water quality urban infrastructure program to
 18 34 develop and maintain an online resource displaying measurable
 18 35 indicators of desirable change in water quality within the
 19  1 state's watersheds.  These measurable indicators may include
 19  2 but are not limited to public and private funding inputs,
 19  3 involvement in water quality projects, and improvements, land
 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor
 19  8 and the general assembly itemizing expenditures under the
 19  9 program during the previous fiscal year.
 19 10    8.  Any information obtained by the division identifying a
 19 11 person holding a legal interest in land or specific land shall
 19 12 be a confidential record under section 22.7.
 19 13    Sec. 24.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the intent of the
 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor
 19  8 and the general assembly itemizing expenditures under the
 19  9 program during the previous fiscal year.
 19 10    8.  Any information obtained by the division identifying a
 19 11 person holding a legal interest in land or specific land shall
 19 12 be a confidential record under section 22.7.
 19 13    Sec. 24.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the intent of the
 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.
       LSB 1844SV (3) 87
       mm/sc
 18 27 use any amount available to support the water quality urban
 18 28 infrastructure program to instead support the three=year data
 18 29 collection of in=field agricultural practices project as
 18 30 enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 18 31    6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section
 18 32 to the contrary, the division may use any amount available
 18 33 to support the water quality urban infrastructure program to
 18 34 develop and maintain an online resource displaying measurable
 18 35 indicators of desirable change in water quality within the
 19  1 state's watersheds.  These measurable indicators may include
 19  2 but are not limited to public and private funding inputs,
 19  3 involvement in water quality projects, and improvements, land
 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor
 19  8 and the general assembly itemizing expenditures under the

 19 12 be a confidential record under section 22.7.
 19 13    Sec. 24.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the intent of the
 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 18 31    6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section
 18 32 to the contrary, the division may use any amount available
 18 33 to support the water quality urban infrastructure program to
 18 34 develop and maintain an online resource displaying measurable
 18 35 indicators of desirable change in water quality within the
 19  1 state's watersheds.  These measurable indicators may include
 19  2 but are not limited to public and private funding inputs,
 19  3 involvement in water quality projects, and improvements, land
 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor
 19  8 and the general assembly itemizing expenditures under the
 19  9 program during the previous fiscal year.
 19 10    8.  Any information obtained by the division identifying a
 19 11 person holding a legal interest in land or specific land shall
 19 12 be a confidential record under section 22.7.
 19 13    Sec. 24.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the intent of the
 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 18 31    6.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section
 18 32 to the contrary, the division may use any amount available
 18 33 to support the water quality urban infrastructure program to
 18 34 develop and maintain an online resource displaying measurable
 18 35 indicators of desirable change in water quality within the
 19  1 state's watersheds.  These measurable indicators may include
 19  2 but are not limited to public and private funding inputs,
 19  3 involvement in water quality projects, and improvements, land
 19  4 use, practice adoption, calculated load reduction, and measured
 19  5 loads at existing monitoring stations.
 19  6    7.  By October 1, 2018, and by October 1 of each year
 19  7 thereafter, the division shall submit a report to the governor
 19  8 and the general assembly itemizing expenditures under the
 19  9 program during the previous fiscal year.
 19 10    8.  Any information obtained by the division identifying a
 19 11 person holding a legal interest in land or specific land shall
 19 12 be a confidential record under section 22.7.
 19 13    Sec. 24.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the intent of the
 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,

 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the

 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water

 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource

 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the

 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.

 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural

 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to

 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 13    Sec. 24.  LEGISLATIVE INTENT.  It is the intent of the
 19 14 general assembly that the amendment in this Act to the
 19 15 definition of point source in section 455B.171, subsection
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal

 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will

 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to

 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.
       LSB 1844SV (3) 87
       mm/sc
 19 16 19, is a conforming amendment consistent with current state
 19 17 and federal law, and that the amendment does not change the
 19 18 application of current law but instead reflects current law
 19 19 both before and after the enactment of this Act.
 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment

 19 20                           EXPLANATION
 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 23    This bill relates to water quality by modifying an existing
 19 24 wastewater treatment program, establishing new water quality
 19 25 programs, providing for appropriations from the rebuild Iowa
 19 26 infrastructure fund and making other appropriations and changes
 19 27 related to water quality, and creating a water service excise
 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 28 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 29    REBUILD IOWA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND APPROPRIATIONS FOR WATER
 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 30 QUALITY AGRICULTURE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.
 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 31    RIIF appropriations ==== The bill provides for a total of
 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;

 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 32 $229.1 million of appropriations over 13 fiscal years from
 19 33 the rebuild Iowa infrastructure fund in Code section 8.57 to
 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 19 34 a water quality infrastructure fund created in the bill (Code
 19 35 section 8.57B) to be used by the division of soil conservation
 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period

 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20  1 and water quality of the department of agriculture and land
 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20  2 stewardship (soil and water division) in administering
 20  3 two new water quality agriculture infrastructure programs,
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;

 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.
       LSB 1844SV (3) 87
       mm/sc
 20  4 described below.  The appropriations shall be as follows: $4.3
 20  5 million for fiscal year 2017=2018; $4.3 million for fiscal
 20  6 year 2018=2019; $11.5 million for fiscal year 2019=2020;
 20  7 $16.5 million per fiscal year for the two=year fiscal period
 20  8 beginning July 1, 2020, and ending June 30, 2022; and $22
 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that

 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of

 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20  9 million per fiscal year for the eight=year fiscal period
 20 10 beginning July 1, 2022, and ending June 30, 2030.  The water
 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general

 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 11 quality infrastructure fund is repealed on the date that
 20 12 all moneys transferred to the fund from the rebuild Iowa
 20 13 infrastructure fund as provided in the bill, including any
 20 14 interest or earnings on such moneys credited to the fund, are
 20 15 expended by the soil and water division, and the balance of the
 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal

 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 20 16 fund is zero.
 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of

 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section

 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight

 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by

 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of

 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban

 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and

 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall

 20 17    Water quality agriculture infrastructure programs ==== As
 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code

 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 18 part of the existing water quality initiative of the soil and
 20 19 water division in Code section 466B.42, the bill establishes
 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.

 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 20 two water quality agriculture infrastructure programs (Code
 20 21 section 466B.43), consisting of an edge=of=field infrastructure
 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation

 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,

 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 22 program and an in=field infrastructure program, that will
 20 23 provide financing on a cost=share basis to certain agriculture
 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or

 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 24 infrastructure projects, including demonstration projects.
 20 25 The edge=of=field program will support projects that capture
 20 26 or filter nutrients entering into surface water.  The bill
 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or

 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 27 includes wetlands, bioreactor systems, saturated buffers, and
 20 28 land use changes as examples of projects that may qualify.
 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such

 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 29 The in=field infrastructure program will support projects
 20 30 that decrease erosion and precipitation=induced surface
 20 31 runoff, increase water infiltration rates, and increase soil
 20 32 sustainability.  The bill includes structures, terraces,
 20 33 waterways located on cropland or pastureland, and soil
 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.

 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 20 34 conservation or erosion control structures or managed drainage
 20 35 systems as examples of projects that may qualify.
 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs

 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall

 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs

 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for

 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users

 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21  1 The bill provides for the purpose of the programs and
 21  2 requires that the programs be administered in a manner that
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of

 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and

 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and

 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.
       LSB 1844SV (3) 87
       mm/sc
 21  3 is consistent with the latest version of the Iowa nutrient
 21  4 reduction strategy initially presented in November 2012 by the
 21  5 department of agriculture and land stewardship, the department
 21  6 of natural resources, and Iowa state university of science
 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible

 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of

 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and

 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21  7 and technology (nutrient reduction strategy).  Both programs
 21  8 require that projects be located on agricultural land and limit
 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal

 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21  9 projects to infrastructure designed and installed for use over
 21 10 multiple years.  The bill requires that the soil and water
 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142

 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21 11 division and landowners enter into agreements for financing
 21 12 projects under the programs, provides that the soil and water
 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation

 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21 13 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 21 14 on a single parcel of land, and provides that the two programs
 21 15 may be combined by the soil and water division if it is cost
 21 16 effective to do so.  The soil and water division is allowed
 21 17 to annually use up to 4 percent of the programs' moneys for
 21 18 administrative purposes.  Beginning in 2018, the soil and
 21 19 water division is required to submit a report by October 1 of
 21 20 each year to the general assembly and the governor detailing
 21 21 expenditures for the previous fiscal year under the programs
 21 22 by hydrologic unit code 8 watershed.  The bill provides that
 21 23 certain information related to agricultural land and obtained
 21 24 by the soil and water division under the programs shall be
 21 25 considered a confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation

 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural

 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required

 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code

 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall

 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section

 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and

 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.

 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further

 21 26    WATER SERVICE EXCISE TAX FOR CERTAIN WATER QUALITY PROGRAMS.
 21 27    Water service excise tax and related sales tax exemption ====
 21 28 The bill exempts from the state sales tax the sales price from
 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.

 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21 29 the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water service in
 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall

 21 30 the state to consumers or users. "Water service" and "water
 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 21 31 utility" are defined in the bill.
 21 32    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 21 33 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 21 34 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 21 35    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 22  1 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall

 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of

 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight

 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field

 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,

 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 29 period between 1980 and 1996.

 22  2 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 22  3 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required
 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight

 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required

 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the

 22  4 to administer the water service tax as nearly as possible
 22  5 in conjunction with the administration of the state sales
 22  6 and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates by
 22  7 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of
 22 16 the water service tax revenues collected on or after July 1,
 22 17 2017, but before August 1, 2018, and increases to one=third,
 22 18 one=half, two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years.
 22 19 All water service tax revenues collected on or after August
 22 20 1, 2022, will be transferred to the water quality financial
 22 21 assistance fund.
 22 22    The water service tax is repealed on the enactment date
 22 23 that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections
 22 32 16.142 through 16.145), and 15 percent is appropriated to the
 22 33 soil and water division to support the water quality urban
 22 34 infrastructure program created in the bill (Code section
 22 35 466B.44).
 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a

 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural

 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States

 22  8 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 22  9    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 22 10 fund of the state, and the bill then requires an increasing
 22 11 portion of the water service tax revenues collected each year
 22 12 to be transferred to a water quality financial assistance fund
 22 13 created in the bill (Code section 16.134A) to support various
 22 14 water quality programs, described below.  Transfers to the
 22 15 water quality financial assistance fund equal one=sixth of

 22 24 increased, or on July 1, 2029, whichever occurs earlier.
 22 25    Water service tax revenues transferred to the water quality
 22 26 financial assistance fund are then appropriated from the
 22 27 fund as follows: 40 percent is appropriated to the Iowa
 22 28 finance authority (IFA) to support the wastewater and drinking
 22 29 water treatment financial assistance program in Code section
 22 30 16.134, 45 percent is appropriated to IFA to support the water
 22 31 quality financing program created in the bill (Code sections

 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.

 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural

 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,

 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through

 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support

 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required

 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.

 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight

 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required

 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural

 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.

 23  1 Wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 23  2 program ==== The bill amends the wastewater treatment financial
 23  3 assistance program administered by IFA in Code section 16.134.
 23  4 Currently, the program provides financial assistance in the
 23  5 form of grants from IFA to disadvantaged communities to install
 23  6 or upgrade wastewater treatment facilities and systems, and
 23  7 for engineering or technical assistance for facility planning
 23  8 and design.  The bill adds drinking water treatment facilities
 23  9 and systems, including source water protection projects, to
 23 10 the program.  The bill also removes the requirement that a
 23 11 community qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to
 23 12 receive financial assistance, instead providing that such
 23 13 disadvantaged communities shall receive priority under the
 23 14 program.  The bill also modifies other priority designations
 23 15 under the program and modifies goals of the program, and
 23 16 provides that a utility management organization formed under
 23 17 Code chapter 28E or operated by a rural water system organized
 23 18 under Code chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for
 23 19 financial assistance under the program.  The bill also adds
 23 20 reporting and review requirements to the program, modifies the
 23 21 permitted use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and
 23 22 creates a water quality financing review committee consisting
 23 23 of three members, as provided in the bill, to review and
 23 24 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 23 25 program.  Finally, the bill requires IFA to submit a report by
 23 26 October 1 of each year to the governor and general assembly
 23 27 detailing expenditures for the previous year under the program,
 23 28 and creates a program review committee consisting of eight
 23 29 members, as provided in the bill, to review the effectiveness
 23 30 of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2027.
 23 31    Water quality financing program (Code sections 16.142
 23 32 through 16.145) ==== This program provides financial assistance
 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,
 24 10 or a landowner, public utility, or rural water district or
 24 11 rural water association.  The bill provides certain application
 24 12 requirements regarding a plan for water quality improvement and
 24 13 financing and requires loan recipients to enter into agreements
 24 14 with IFA for terms of the financial assistance.
 24 15    In order to be eligible for financial assistance, a proposed
 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal
 24 26 year.
 24 27    Water quality urban infrastructure program (Code section
 24 28 466B.44) ==== As part of the existing water quality initiative
 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall

 23 33 in the form of loans, forgivable loans, and grants to enhance
 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary

 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through

 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural

 23 34 the quality of surface water and groundwater, particularly
 23 35 by providing financial assistance for projects designed
 24  1 to improve water quality by addressing point and nonpoint
 24  2 sources.  The program is administered by IFA in cooperation
 24  3 with the department of natural resources and the department of
 24  4 agriculture and land stewardship.  The bill creates a water
 24  5 quality financing program fund administered by IFA to provide
 24  6 financial assistance under the program.  The bill allows IFA
 24  7 to establish and maintain other funds and accounts necessary
 24  8 to carry out the purposes of the program.  Under the program,
 24  9 an eligible entity is a municipality, as defined in the bill,

 24 16 project must improve water quality in the local area or
 24 17 watershed using practices identified in the Iowa nutrient
 24 18 reduction strategy.  Drainage and levee districts are required
 24 19 to utilize installations described in the edge=of=field
 24 20 infrastructure program (Code section 466B.43), discussed above.
 24 21 IFA reviews proposed projects, negotiates project details, and
 24 22 approves or denies applications.
 24 23    Beginning in 2018, IFA is required to submit a report by
 24 24 October 1 of each year to the general assembly and the governor
 24 25 detailing expenditures from the fund for the previous fiscal

 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through

 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required

 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required

 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.
 25 26    MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES.  The bill defines "Iowa nutrient
 25 27 reduction strategy" and "nutrient" in Code section 455B.171,
 25 28 which contains definitions for terms used in provisions of
 25 29 the Code that concern the jurisdiction of the department of
 25 30 natural resources related to water quality, and also amends
 25 31 the definition of "point source" in that Code section to
 25 32 exclude agricultural storm water discharges and return flows
 25 33 from irrigated agriculture.  The bill provides that it is the
 25 34 legislative intent of the general assembly that this amendment
 25 35 to the definition of "point source" is a conforming amendment
 26  1 consistent with current state and federal law, and that the
 26  2 amendment does not change the application of current law but
 26  3 instead reflects current law both before and after enactment
 26  4 of the bill.
 26  5    The bill amends the declaration of policy for the department
 26  6 of natural resources' water quality jurisdiction in Code
 26  7 section 455B.177 to include in such policy the assessment
 26  8 and reduction of nutrients in surface waters over time by
 26  9 implementing the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy, and further
 26 10 adds that progress under the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy
 26 11 and the United States environmental protection agency gulf
 26 12 hypoxia action plan shall be evaluated using a baseline
 26 13 condition calculated for the time period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 14    The bill amends Code section 466B.3, relating to the water
 26 15 resources coordinating council, to provide that when the
 26 16 council is measuring the success of its efforts, progress under
 26 17 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 18 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 19 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time
 26 20 period between 1980 and 1996.
 26 21    The bill amends Code section 466B.42, relating to the water
 26 22 quality initiative of the soil and water division, to provide
 26 23 that the goal of the water quality initiative is to implement
 26 24 the soil and water division's responsibilities under the Iowa
 26 25 nutrient reduction strategy, and to provide that progress under
 26 26 the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy and the United States
 26 27 environmental protection agency gulf hypoxia action plan shall
 26 28 be evaluated using a baseline condition calculated for the time

 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
 25 19    Beginning in 2018, the soil and water division is required
 25 20 to submit a report by October 1 of each year to the general
 25 21 assembly and the governor detailing expenditures for the
 25 22 previous fiscal year under the program.  The bill provides that
 25 23 certain information related to the land and obtained by the
 25 24 soil and water division under the program shall be considered a
 25 25 confidential record under Code section 22.7.

 24 29 of the soil and water division in Code section 466B.42, the
 24 30 bill creates a water quality urban infrastructure program
 24 31 to support watershed projects and advance implementation
 24 32 of the Iowa nutrient reduction strategy.  Program support
 24 33 may include demonstration projects that decrease erosion,
 24 34 precipitation=induced surface runoff, and storm water
 24 35 discharges and that increase water infiltration rates.
 25  1 Projects shall be based on Iowa's storm water management manual
 25  2 published by the department of natural resources.  Financial
 25  3 assistance is provided on a cost=share basis or through
 25  4 cooperative agreements with certain watersheds as described
 25  5 in the bill.  The bill requires the soil and water division
 25  6 and landowners to enter into agreements for financing projects
 25  7 under the program, and provides that the soil and water
 25  8 division may support multiple installations of infrastructure
 25  9 on a single parcel of land.  The soil and water division is
 25 10 allowed to annually use up to 4 percent of the program's moneys
 25 11 for administrative purposes.
 25 12    The soil and water division may use any amount available
 25 13 under the program to develop and maintain an online resource
 25 14 displaying measurable indicators of desirable change in water
 25 15 quality within the state's watersheds, and beginning July 1,
 25 16 2019, may use any amount available under the program to support
 25 17 the three=year data collection of the in=field agricultural
 25 18 practices project as enacted in 2015 Iowa Acts, ch. 132, {18.
